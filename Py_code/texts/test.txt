''fire in the minds of men: origins of the revolutionary faith'' new jersey: transaction books, p 417.&lt;/ref&gt; a variety of anarchists advocated the abandonment of these sorts of tactics in favour of collective revolutionary action, for example through the trade union movement. the anarcho-syndicalist, [[fernand pelloutier]], argued in 1895 for renewed anarchist involvement in the labour movement on the basis that anarchism could do very well without "the individual dynamiter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blackrosebooks.net/anarism1.htm |title=table of contents |publisher=blackrosebooks.net |date= |accessdate=20 september 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"in march 1871 the commune took power in the abandoned city and held it for two months. then [[adolphe thiers|versailles]] seized the moment to attack and, in one horrifying week, executed roughly 20,000 communards or suspected sympathizers, a number higher than those killed in the recent war or during [[robespierre]]'s '[[reign of terror|terror]]' of 1793&#x2013;1794. more than 7,500 were jailed or deported to places like new caledonia. thousands of others fled to belgium, england, italy, spain and the united states. in 1872, stringent laws were passed that ruled out all possibilities of organising on the left. not till 1880 was there a general amnesty for exiled and imprisoned communards. meanwhile, the third republic found itself strong enough to renew and reinforce [[napoleon iii of france|louis napoleon]]'s imperialist expansion &#x2013; in indochina, africa, and oceania. many of france's leading intellectuals and artists had participated in the commune ([[gustave courbet|courbet]] was its quasi-minister of culture, [[arthur rimbaud|rimbaud]] and [[pissarro]] were active propagandists) or were sympathetic to it. the ferocious repression of 1871 and thereafter, was probably the key factor in alienating these milieux from the third republic and stirring their sympathy for its victims at home and abroad." {{cite journal | last = anderson | first = benedict | author-link = benedict anderson | title = in the world-shadow of bismarck and nobel | journal = [[new left review]] | volume = ii | issue = 28 | pages = 85&#x2013;129 | publisher = new left review | date = july&#x2013;august 2004 | url = http://newleftreview.org/ii/28/benedict-anderson-in-the-world-shadow-of-bismarck-and-nobel | ref = harv | postscript = .| access-date = 2016-01-07 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151219130121/http://newleftreview.org/ii/28/benedict-anderson-in-the-world-shadow-of-bismarck-and-nobel | archive-date = 2015-12-19 }} &lt;/blockquote&gt;

 ===neuropsychology=== two major categories of [[cognitive]] theories have been proposed about the links between autistic brains and behavior.  the first category focuses on deficits in [[social cognition]]. [[simon baron-cohen]]'s [[empathizing&#x2013;systemizing theory]] postulates that autistic individuals can systemize&#x2014;that is, they can develop internal rules of operation to handle events inside the brain&#x2014;but are less effective at empathizing by handling events generated by other agents. an extension, the extreme male brain theory, hypothesizes that autism is an extreme case of the male brain, defined psychometrically as individuals in whom systemizing is better than empathizing.&lt;ref name=e-s-theory/&gt;  these theories are somewhat related to baron-cohen's earlier [[theory of mind]] approach, which hypothesizes that autistic behavior arises from an inability to ascribe mental states to oneself and others. the theory of mind hypothesis is supported by the atypical responses of children with autism to the [[sally&#x2013;anne test]] for reasoning about others' motivations,&lt;ref name="e-s-theory"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = baron-cohen s | title = autism: the empathizing&#x2013;systemizing (e-s) theory | journal = annals of the new york academy of sciences | volume = 1156 | pages = 68&#x2013;80 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19338503 | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04467.x | url = http://docs.autismresearchcentre.com/papers/2009_bc_nyas.pdf | format = pdf | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131214134422/http://docs.autismresearchcentre.com/papers/2009_bc_nyas.pdf | archivedate = 14 december 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the mirror neuron system theory of autism described in ''[[#pathophysiology|pathophysiology]]'' maps well to the hypothesis.&lt;ref name=iacoboni/&gt; however, most studies have found no evidence of impairment in autistic individuals' ability to understand other people's basic intentions or goals; instead, data suggests that impairments are found in understanding more complex social emotions or in considering others' viewpoints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = hamilton af | title = goals, intentions and mental states: challenges for theories of autism | journal = j child psychol psychiatry | volume = 50 | issue = 8 | pages = 881&#x2013;92 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19508497 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2009.02098.x | citeseerx = 10.1.1.621.6275 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  the second category focuses on nonsocial or general processing: the [[executive functions]] such as [[working memory]], planning, [[inhibition theory|inhibition]]. in his review, kenworthy states that "the claim of [[executive dysfunction]] as a causal factor in autism is controversial", however, "it is clear that executive dysfunction plays a role in the social and cognitive deficits observed in individuals with autism".&lt;ref name=kenworthy/&gt;

and that executive function deficits have not been found in young children with autism.&lt;ref name=sigman/&gt;  [[weak central coherence theory]] hypothesizes that a limited ability to see the big picture underlies the central disturbance in autism. one strength of this theory is predicting special talents and peaks in performance in autistic people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = happ&#xe9;

[[cryoconite]], powdery windblown [[dust]] containing soot, sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets.&lt;ref name = "nat. geo"&gt;[http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2010/06/melt-zone/jenkins-text/3 "changing greenland &#x2013; melt zone"] page 3, of 4, article by mark jenkins in ''[[national geographic (magazine)|national geographic]]'' june 2010, accessed 8 july 2010&lt;/ref&gt; hence, small errors in albedo can lead to large errors in energy estimates, which is why it is important to measure the albedo of snow-covered areas through remote sensing techniques rather than applying a single value over broad regions.  ===small-scale effects=== albedo works on a smaller scale, too. in sunlight, dark clothes absorb more heat and light-coloured clothes reflect it better, thus allowing some control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing.&lt;ref name="ranknfile-ue"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ranknfile-ue.org/h&amp;s0897.html |title=health and safety: be cool!

[[deciduous trees]] have an albedo value of about 0.15 to 0.18 whereas [[coniferous trees]] have a value of about 0.09 to 0.15.&lt;ref name="mmutrees" /&gt;  studies by the [[hadley centre]] have investigated the relative (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of [[carbon sequestration]] on planting forests. they found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high latitudes (e.g., siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming.&lt;ref name="betts" /&gt;  ===water=== water reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials. the reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the [[fresnel equations]] (see graph). [[file:water reflectivity.jpg|thumb|right|250px|reflectivity of smooth water at 20&amp;nbsp;&#xb0;c (refractive index=1.333)]] at the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally [[specular reflection|specular manner]] (not [[diffuse reflection|diffusely]]). the glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this. at small [[angle of incidence (optics)|angles of incident]] light, [[waviness]] results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity-vs.-incident-angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle.&lt;ref name="fresnel" /&gt;  although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light, it becomes very high at high angles of incident light such as those that occur on the illuminated side of earth near the [[terminator (solar)|terminator]] (early morning, late afternoon, and near the poles). however, as mentioned above, waviness causes an appreciable reduction. because light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer, water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light.  note that white caps on waves look white (and have high albedo) because the water is foamed up, so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect, adding up their reflectivities. fresh 'black' ice exhibits fresnel reflection.  ===clouds=== [[cloud albedo]] has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures. different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity, theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near 0 to a maximum approaching 0.8. "on any given day, about half of earth is covered by clouds, which reflect more sunlight than land and water. clouds keep earth cool by reflecting sunlight, but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth."&lt;ref name="livescience"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/environment/060124_earth_albedo.html |title=baffled scientists say less sunlight reaching earth |publisher=livescience |date=24 january 2006 |accessdate=19 august 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  albedo and climate in some areas are affected by artificial clouds, such as those created by the [[contrail]]s of heavy commercial airliner traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=contrails reduce daily temperature range|url=http://facstaff.uww.edu/travisd/pdf/jetcontrailsrecentresearch.pdf|journal=nature |accessdate=7 july 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060503192714/http://facstaff.uww.edu/travisd/pdf/jetcontrailsrecentresearch.pdf|archivedate=3 may 2006|page=601|volume=418|format=pdf|date=8 august 2002|deadurl=yes|doi=10.1038/418601a|bibcode = 2002natur.418..601t|pmid=12167846}}&lt;/ref&gt; a study following the burning of the kuwaiti oil fields during iraqi occupation showed that temperatures under the burning oil fires were as much as 10&amp;nbsp;&#xb0;c colder than temperatures several miles away under clear skies.&lt;ref name="harvard"&gt;{{cite journal |title=the kuwait oil fires as seen by landsat |publisher=adsabs.harvard.edu |date=30 may 1991|bibcode=1992jgr....9714565c |author1=cahalan |first1=robert f. |volume=97 |page=14565 |journal=journal of geophysical research: atmospheres |doi=10.1029/92jd00799|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23842551 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ===aerosol effects=== [[aerosols]] (very fine particles/droplets in the atmosphere) have both direct and indirect effects on earth's radiative balance. the direct (albedo) effect is generally to cool the planet; the indirect effect (the particles act as [[cloud condensation nuclei]] and thereby change cloud properties) is less certain.&lt;ref name="girda"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/231.htm#671 |title=climate change 2001: the scientific basis |publisher=grida.no |accessdate=19 august 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110629175429/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/231.htm| archivedate= 29 june 2011&lt;!--added by dashbot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; as per &lt;ref name="dominick" /&gt; the effects are: &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;!-- aerosol radiative forcing. --&gt; * ''aerosol direct effect.'' aerosols directly scatter and absorb radiation. the scattering of radiation causes atmospheric cooling, whereas absorption can cause atmospheric warming. * ''aerosol indirect effect.'' aerosols modify the properties of clouds through a subset of the aerosol population called [[cloud condensation nuclei]]. increased nuclei concentrations lead to increased cloud droplet number concentrations, which in turn leads to increased cloud albedo, increased light scattering and radiative cooling (''first indirect effect''), but also leads to reduced precipitation efficiency and increased lifetime of the cloud (''second indirect effect''). &lt;/blockquote&gt;  ===black carbon=== another albedo-related effect on the climate is from [[black carbon]] particles. the size of this effect is difficult to quantify: the [[intergovernmental panel on climate change]] estimates that the global mean radiative forcing for black carbon aerosols from fossil fuels is +0.2 w m&lt;sup&gt;&#x2212;2&lt;/sup&gt;, with a range +0.1 to +0.4 w m&lt;sup&gt;&#x2212;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="girda 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/233.htm |title=climate change 2001: the scientific basis |publisher=grida.no |accessdate=19 august 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110629180154/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/233.htm| archivedate= 29 june 2011&lt;!--added by dashbot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; black carbon is a bigger cause of the melting of the polar ice cap in the arctic than carbon dioxide due to its effect on the albedo.&lt;ref&gt;james hansen &amp; larissa nazarenko, ''soot climate forcing via snow and ice albedos'', 101 proc. of the nat'l. acad. of sci. 423 (13 january 2004) ("the efficacy of this forcing is &#xbb;2 (i.e., for a given forcing it is twice as effective as co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in altering global surface air temperature)"); ''compare'' zender testimony, ''supra'' note 7, at 4 (figure 3); see j. hansen &amp; l. nazarenko, ''supra'' note 18, at 426.

 [[file:lowercasea.svg|left|thumb|200px|typographic variants include a double-storey '''a''' and single-storey '''&#x251;'''.]]at the end of the [[roman empire]] (5th century ad), several variants of the cursive minuscule developed through western europe. among these were the semicursive minuscule of [[italy]], the [[merovingian script]] in france, the [[visigothic script]] in spain, and the [[insular script|insular]] or anglo-irish semi-uncial or anglo-saxon majuscule of great britain. by the 9th century, the [[carolingian minuscule|caroline script]], which was very similar to the present-day form, was the principal form used in book-making, before the advent of the printing press. this form was derived through a combining of prior forms.&lt;ref name=americana/&gt;  15th-century italy saw the formation of the two main variants that are known today. these variants, the ''italic'' and ''roman'' forms, were derived from the caroline script version. the italic form, also called ''script a,'' is used in most current [[handwriting]] and consists of a circle and vertical stroke. this slowly developed from the fifth-century form resembling the greek letter [[tau]] in the hands of medieval irish and english writers.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; the roman form is used in most printed material; it consists of a small loop with an arc over it ("a").&lt;ref name=americana/&gt; both derive from the majuscule (capital) form. in greek handwriting, it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into a single loop, as demonstrated by the uncial version shown. many fonts then made the right leg vertical. in some of these, the [[serif]] that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc, resulting in the printed form, while in others it was dropped, resulting in the modern handwritten form.  [[italic type]] is commonly used to mark emphasis or more generally to distinguish one part of a text from the rest (set in roman type). there are some other cases aside from italic type where ''script a'' ("&#x251;"), also called [[latin alpha]], is used in contrast with latin "a" (such as in the [[international phonetic alphabet]]).  ==use in writing systems== [[file:pronunciation_of_the_name_of_the_letter_&#x27e8;a&#x27e9;_in_european_languages.png|thumb|pronunciation of the name of the letter {{angbr|a}} in european languages, note that /a/ and /a&#x2d0;/ can differ phonetically between {{ipablink|a}}, {{ipablink|&#xe4;}}, {{ipablink|&#xe6;}} and {{ipablink|&#x251;}} depending on the language.|305x305px]]  ===english=== {{further information|pronunciation of english &#x27e8;a&#x27e9;}} in modern [[english orthography]], the letter {{angbr|a}} represents at least seven different vowel sounds: *the [[near-open front unrounded vowel]] {{ipa|/&#xe6;/}} as in ''pad'';

a capital a is also typically used as one of the letters to represent an angle in a [[triangle]], the lowercase a representing the side opposite angle a.&lt;ref name=coll/&gt;  "a" is often used to denote something or someone of a better or more prestigious quality or status: a-, a or a+, the best grade that can be assigned by teachers for students' schoolwork; "a grade" for clean restaurants; [[a-list]] celebrities, etc. such associations can have a [[motivation|motivating]] effect, as exposure to the letter a has been found to improve performance, when compared with other letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|british psychological society|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

other changes were made to implement representative state house and senate districts.  african americans continued to press in the 1950s and 1960s to end disenfranchisement and segregation in the state through the [[civil rights movement]], including legal challenges. in 1954, the us supreme court ruled in ''[[brown v. board of education]]'' that public schools had to be desegregated, but alabama was slow to comply. during the 1960s, under governor [[george wallace]], alabama resisted compliance with federal demands for [[desegregation]]. the civil rights movement had notable events in alabama, including the [[montgomery bus boycott]] (1955&#x2013;56), [[freedom rides]] in 1961, and 1965 [[selma to montgomery marches]]. these contributed to congressional passage and enactment of the [[civil rights act of 1964]]&lt;ref name="cra64"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://finduslaw.com/civil_rights_act_of_1964_cra_title_vii_equal_employment_opportunities_42_us_code_chapter_21 |title=civil rights act of 1964 |publisher=finduslaw.com |accessdate=october 24, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021141154/http://finduslaw.com/civil_rights_act_of_1964_cra_title_vii_equal_employment_opportunities_42_us_code_chapter_21 |archivedate=october 21, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

 despite recommendations of a 1973 alabama constitutional commission, the state legislature did not approve an amendment to establish home rule for counties. there is very limited home rule, but the legislature is deeply involved in passing legislation that applies to county-level functions and policies. this both deprives local residents of the ability to govern themselves and distracts the legislature from statewide issues.   alabama has made some changes since the late 20th century and has used new types of voting to increase representation. in the 1980s, an omnibus redistricting case, ''[[dillard v. crenshaw county]]'', challenged the [[at-large]] voting for representative seats of 180 alabama jurisdictions, including counties and school boards. at-large voting had diluted the votes of any minority in a county, as the majority tended to take all seats. despite african americans making up a significant minority in the state, they had been unable to elect any representatives in most of the at-large jurisdictions.  as part of settlement of this case, five alabama cites and counties, including [[chilton county, alabama|chilton county]], adopted a system of [[proportional representation|cumulative voting]] for election of representatives in multi-seat jurisdictions. this has resulted in more proportional representation for voters. in another form of proportional representation, 23 jurisdictions use limited voting, as in [[conecuh county, alabama|conecuh county]]. in 1982, limited voting was first tested in [[conecuh county, alabama|conecuh county]]. together use of these systems has increased the number of african americans and women being elected to local offices, resulting in governments that are more representative of their citizens.&lt;ref name="cum"&gt;[http://archive.fairvote.org/?page=516 "cumulative elections in alabama (2004)"/"proportional voting in alabama"], fairvote archives, accessed january 11, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

"the lack of home rule for counties in alabama has resulted in the proliferation of local legislation permitting counties to do things not authorized by the state constitution. alabama's constitution has been amended more than 700 times, and almost one-third of the amendments are local in nature, applying to only one county or city. a significant part of each legislative session is spent on local legislation, taking away time and attention of legislators from issues of statewide importance."&lt;ref name="home"&gt;[http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-1153#sthash.cmemrnbk.dpuf albert

era|reconstruction]] following the [[american civil war]], alabama was occupied by federal troops of the [[third military district]] under [[john pope (military officer)|general john pope]]. in 1874, the political coalition of white democrats known as the [[redeemers]] took control of the state government from the republicans, in part by suppressing the african-american vote through violence, fraud and intimidation.  after 1890, a coalition of white democratic politicians passed laws to [[racial segregation|segregate]] and disenfranchise african american residents, a process completed in provisions of the 1901 constitution. provisions which disenfranchised african americans resulted in excluding many poor whites. by 1941 more whites than african americans had been disenfranchised: 600,000 to 520,000. the total effects were greater on the african-american community, as almost all of its citizens were disfranchised and relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law.  from 1901 through the 1960s, the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state during urbanization and industrialization of certain areas. as counties were the basis of election districts, the result was a rural minority that dominated state politics through nearly three-quarters of the century, until a series of federal court cases required redistricting in 1972 to meet equal representation.  alabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the [[civil rights movement]], when whites bureaucratically, and at times, violently resisted protests for electoral and social reform. governor [[george wallace]], the state's only four-term governor, was a controversial figure who vowed to maintain segregation. only after passage of the federal [[civil rights act of 1964]]&lt;ref name="cra64"/&gt; and [[voting rights act of 1965]] did african americans regain the ability to exercise suffrage, among other civil rights. in many jurisdictions, they continued to be excluded from representation by [[at-large]] electoral systems, which allowed the majority of the population to dominate elections. some changes at the county level have occurred following court challenges to establish [[single-member districts]] that enable a more diverse representation among county boards.  in 2007, the [[alabama legislature]] passed, and republican governor [[bob riley]] signed a resolution expressing "profound regret" over slavery and its lingering impact. in a symbolic ceremony, the bill was signed in the [[alabama state capitol]], which housed congress of the [[confederate states of america]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=phillip |last=rawls |title=alabama offers an apology for slavery

a nearly complete realignment of political parties, who represent different visions in the 21st century.  ===elections=== {{main article|elections in alabama}}  ====state elections==== with the [[disfranchisement after reconstruction era|disfranchisement of african americans]] in 1901, the state became part of the "[[solid south]]", a system in which the [[democratic party (united

democratic party [[primary election|primary]], with generally only token [[republican party (united states)|republican]] challengers running in the general election. since the mid to late 20th century, however, there has been a realignment among the two major political parties, and white conservatives started shifting to the republican party. in alabama, majority-white districts are now expected to regularly elect republican candidates to federal, state and local office.  members of the nine seats on the [[alabama supreme court]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite

justice of alabama, [[ernest c. hornsby]], refused to leave office after losing the election by approximately 3,000 votes to republican [[perry o. hooper, sr.]]. hornsby sued alabama and defiantly remained in office for nearly a year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court. this ultimately led to a collapse of support for democrats at the ballot box in the next three or four election cycles. the democrats lost the last of the nineteen court seats in august 2011 with the resignation of the last democrat on the bench.  in the early 21st century, republicans hold all seven of the [[political party strength in alabama|statewide elected executive]] branch offices. republicans hold six of the eight elected seats on the [[alabama state board of education]]. in 2010, republicans took large majorities of both chambers of the state legislature, giving them control of that body for the first time in 136 years. the last remaining statewide democrat, who served on the

the grief or distress of the people is a theme raised numerous times in the ''iliad'' (and frequently by achilles himself). achilles' role as the hero of grief or distress forms an ironic juxtaposition with the conventional view of him as the hero of {{lang|grc|&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3ad;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;}} ''{{transl|grc|kl&#xe9;os}}'' ("glory", usually in war). furthermore, ''la&#xf3;s'' has been construed by [[gregory nagy]], following [[leonard palmer]], to mean "a corps of soldiers", a [[muster (military)|muster]].&lt;ref name=nagy/&gt; with this derivation, the name obtains a double meaning in the poem: when the hero is functioning rightly, his men bring distress to the enemy, but when wrongly, his men get the grief of war. the poem is in part about the misdirection of anger on the part of leadership.  another etymology relates the name to a [[proto-indo-european]] [[compound (linguistics)|compound]] ''*h&#x2082;e&#x1e31;-p&#x1e53;ds'' "sharp foot" which first gave an [[illyrian languages|illyrian]] ''*&#x101;k&#x302;pedi&#xf3;s'', evolving through time into ''*&#x101;khpde&#xf3;s'' and then ''*akhidde&#xfa;s''. the shift from ''-dd-'' to ''-ll-'' is then ascribed to the passing of the name into greek via a [[pre-greek]] source. the first root part ''*h&#x2082;e&#x1e31;-'' "sharp, pointed" also gave greek &#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3ae; (''ak&#x1e17;'' "point, silence, healing"), &#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bc;&#x3ae; (''akm&#x1e17;'' "point, edge, zenith") and &#x1f40;&#x3be;&#x3cd;&#x3c2; (''ox&#xfa;s'' "sharp, pointed, keen, quick, clever"), whereas &#x1f04;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; stems from the root ''*h&#x2082;eg&#x2b0;-'' "to be upset, afraid". the whole expression would be comparable to the [[latin]] ''acupedius'' "swift of foot". compare also the latin word family of ''aci&#x113;s'' "sharp edge or point, battle line, battle, engagement", ''acus'' "needle, pin, bodkin", and ''acu&#x14d;'' "to make pointed, sharpen, whet; to exercise; to arouse" (whence ''acute'').&lt;ref&gt;cf. the wiktionary entries [[wikt:&#x1f08;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3cd;&#x3c2;|"&#x1f08;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3cd;&#x3c2;"]] and [[wikt:reconstruction:proto-indo-european/h&#x2082;e&#x1e31;-|''*h&#x2082;e&#x1e31;-'']].&lt;/ref&gt; some [[literary topos|topical]] [[epitheta]] of achilles in the ''iliad'' point to this "swift-footedness", namely &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3ac;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;

(see [[achilles' heel]], [[achilles' tendon]]). it is not clear if this version of events was known earlier. in another version of this story, thetis anointed the boy in [[ambrosia]] and put him on top of a fire, to burn away the mortal parts of his body. she was interrupted by peleus and abandoned both father and son in a rage.&lt;ref&gt;[[apollonius of rhodes]], ''[[argonautica]]'' 4.869&#x2013;879.&lt;/ref&gt;  however, none of the sources before statius makes any reference to this general invulnerability. to the contrary, in the ''iliad'' homer mentions achilles being wounded: in book 21 the [[paeonian]] hero [[asteropaeus]], son of [[pelagon]], challenged achilles by the river [[scamander]]. he cast two spears at once, one grazed achilles' elbow, "drawing a spurt of blood".  also, in the fragmentary poems of the [[epic cycle]] in which we can find description of the hero's death (i.e. the ''[[cypria]]'', the ''[[little iliad]]'' by [[lesches]] of pyrrha, the ''[[aithiopis]]'' and ''[[iliou persis]]'' by [[arctinus of miletus]]), there is no trace of any reference to his general invulnerability or his famous weakness at the heel; in the later vase paintings presenting achilles' death, the arrow (or in many cases, arrows) hit his body. peleus entrusted achilles to [[chiron]] the [[centaur]], on [[mount pelion]], to be reared.&lt;ref&gt;[[hesiod]], ''catalogue of women'', fr. 204.87&#x2013;89 mw; ''iliad'' 11.830&#x2013;832.&lt;/ref&gt; thetis foretold that her son's fate was either to gain glory and die young, or to live a long but uneventful life in obscurity.  achilles chose the former, and decided to take part in the trojan war.&lt;ref&gt;''iliad'' 9.410ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

pliny's contemporary [[pomponius mela]] (c. 43 ad) tells that achilles was buried on an island named ''achillea'', situated between the [[borysthenes]] and the [[danube|ister]], adding to the geographical confusion.&lt;ref&gt;pomponius mela, ''de situ orbis'' 2.7.&lt;/ref&gt; ruins of a square temple, measuring 30 meters to a side, possibly that dedicated to achilles, were discovered by captain kritzikly in 1823 on snake island. a second exploration in 1840 showed that the construction of a lighthouse had destroyed all traces of this temple. a fifth century bc [[black-glazed ware|black-glazed]] [[lekythos]] inscription, found on the island in 1840, reads: "glaukos, son of poseidon, dedicated me to achilles, lord of leuke." in another inscription from the fifth or fourth century bc, a statue is dedicated to achilles, lord of leuke, by a citizen of olbia, while in a further dedication, the city of olbia confirms its continuous maintenance of the island's cult, again suggesting its quality as a place of a supra-regional hero veneration.&lt;ref name=hedreen/&gt;  the heroic cult dedicated to achilles on ''leuce'' seems to go back to an account from the lost epic ''[[aethiopis]]'' according to which, after his untimely death, thetis had snatched her son from the funeral pyre and removed him to a mythical &#x39b;&#x3b5;&#x3cd;&#x3ba;&#x3b7; &#x39d;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; (''le&#xfa;k&#x113; n&#xea;sos'' "white island").&lt;ref&gt;[[proclus]], ''chrestomathia'' 2.&lt;/ref&gt; already in the fifth century bc, [[pindar]] had mentioned a cult of achilles on a "bright island" (&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3ac; &#x3bd;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, ''phaenn&#xe1; n&#xe2;sos'') of the black sea,&lt;ref&gt;pindar, ''nemea'' 4.49ff.; arrian, ''[[periplus of the euxine sea]]'' 21.&lt;/ref&gt; while in another of his works, pindar would retell the story of the immortalized achilles living on a geographically indefinite [[island of the blest]] together with other heroes such as his father [[peleus]] and [[cadmus]].&lt;ref&gt;pindar, ''olympia'' 2.78ff.&lt;/ref&gt; well known is the connection of these mythological [[fortunate isles]] (&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd; &#x3bd;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;, ''mak&#xe1;r&#xf4;n n&#xea;soi'') or the homeric [[elysium]] with the stream [[oceanus]] which according to greek mythology surrounds the inhabited world, which should have accounted for the identification of the northern strands of the euxine with it.&lt;ref name=hedreen/&gt; guy hedreen has found further evidence for this connection of achilles with the northern margin of the inhabited world in a poem by [[alcaeus of mytilene|alcaeus]], speaking of "achilles lord of scythia"&lt;ref&gt;d. page, ''lyrica graeca selecta'', oxford 1968, p. 89, no. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; and the opposition of north and south, as evoked by achilles' fight against the [[aethiopia]]n prince [[memnon (mythology)|memnon]], who in his turn would be removed to his homeland by his mother [[eos]] after his death.  the ''[[periplus ponti euxini|periplus of the euxine sea]]'' (c. 130 ad) gives the following details:  {{quote|it is said that the goddess thetis raised this island from the sea, for her son achilles, who dwells there. here is his temple and his statue, an archaic work. this island is not inhabited, and goats graze on it, not many, which the people who happen to arrive here with their ships, sacrifice to achilles. in this temple are also deposited a great many holy gifts, craters, rings and precious stones, offered to achilles in gratitude. one can still read inscriptions in greek and latin, in which achilles is praised and celebrated. some of these are worded in patroclus&#x2019; honour, because those who wish to be favored by achilles, honour patroclus at the same time. there are also in this island countless numbers of sea birds, which look after achilles&#x2019; temple. every morning they fly out to sea, wet their wings with water, and return quickly to the temple and sprinkle it. and after they finish the sprinkling, they clean the hearth of the temple with their wings. other people say still more, that some of the men who reach this island, come here intentionally. they bring animals in their ships, destined to be sacrificed. some of these animals they slaughter, others they set free on the island, in achilles&#x2019; honour. but there are others, who are forced to come to this island by sea storms. as they have no sacrificial animals, but wish to get them from the god of the island himself, they consult achilles' oracle. they ask permission to slaughter the victims chosen from among the animals that graze freely on the island, and to deposit in exchange the price which they consider fair. but in case the oracle denies them permission, because there is an oracle here, they add something to the price offered, and if the oracle refuses again, they add something more, until at last, the oracle agrees that the price is sufficient. and then the victim doesn&#x2019;t run away any more, but waits willingly to be caught. so, there is a great quantity of silver there, consecrated to the hero, as price for the sacrificial victims. to some of the people who come to this island, achilles appears in dreams, to others he would appear even during their navigation, if they were not too far away, and would instruct them as to which part of the island they would better anchor their ships.&lt;ref name=densu&#x15f;ianu/&gt;}}  the greek geographer [[dionysius periegetes]], who lived probably during the first century ad, wrote that the island was called ''leuce'' "because the wild animals which live there are white. it is said that there, in leuce island, reside the souls of achilles and other heroes, and that they wander through the uninhabited valleys of this island; this is how jove rewarded the men who had distinguished themselves through their virtues, because through virtue they had acquired everlasting honour".&lt;ref&gt;dionysius periegetes, ''orbis descriptio'' 5.541, quoted in densu&#x15f;ianu 1913.&lt;/ref&gt; similarly, others relate the island's name to its white cliffs, snakes or birds dwelling there.&lt;ref&gt;arrian, ''[[periplus of the euxine sea]]'' 21; scholion to pindar, ''nemea'' 4.79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hedreen/&gt; [[pausanias (geographer)|pausanias]] has been told that the island is "covered with forests and full of animals, some wild, some tame. in this island there is also achilles' temple and his statue".&lt;ref&gt;pausanias, ''description of greece'' 3.19.11.&lt;/ref&gt; leuce had also a reputation as a place of healing. pausanias reports that the [[delphi]]c [[pythia]] sent a lord of [[crotone|croton]] to be cured of a chest wound.&lt;ref&gt;pausanias, ''description of greece'' 3.19.13.&lt;/ref&gt; [[ammianus marcellinus]] attributes the healing to waters (''aquae'') on the island.&lt;ref&gt;ammianus marcellinus, ''res gestae'' 22.8.&lt;/ref&gt;  a number of important commercial port cities of the greek waters were dedicated to achilles. [[herodotus]], [[pliny the elder]] and [[strabo]] reported on the existence of a town ''ach&#xed;lleion'' (&#x1f08;&#x3c7;&#x3af;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;), built by settlers from [[mytilene]] in the sixth century bc, close to the hero's presumed burial mound in the [[troad]].&lt;ref name=troad/&gt; later attestations point to an ''ach&#xed;lleion'' in [[messenia]] (according to [[stephanus byzantinus]]) and an ''ach&#xed;lleios'' (&#x1f08;&#x3c7;&#x3af;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;) in [[laconia]].&lt;ref&gt;pausanias, ''description of greece'' 3.25.4.&lt;/ref&gt; [[nicolae densu&#x15f;ianu]] recognized a connection to achilles in the names of [[aquileia]] and of the northern arm of the danube delta, called [[chilia veche|chilia]] (presumably from an older ''achileii''), though his conclusion, that leuce had sovereign rights over the black sea, evokes modern rather than archaic sea-law.&lt;ref name=densu&#x15f;ianu&gt;nicolae densu&#x15f;ianu: ''dacia preistoric&#x103;''. bucharest: carol g&#xf6;bl, 1913.&lt;/ref&gt;  the kings of [[epirus (ancient state)|epirus]] claimed to be descended from achilles through his son, [[neoptolemus]]. [[alexander the great]], son of the epirote princess [[olympias]], could therefore also claim this descent, and in many ways strove to be like his great ancestor. he is said to have visited the tomb of achilles at [[achilleion (troad)#tomb of achilles|achilleion]] while passing troy.&lt;ref&gt;[[arrian]], ''[[anabasis alexandri]]'' 1.12.1, [[cicero]], ''pro archia poeta'' 24.&lt;/ref&gt; in ad 216 the roman emperor [[caracalla]], while on his way to war against [[parthia]], emulated alexander by holding games around achilles' tumulus.&lt;ref&gt;[[dio cassius]] 78.16.7.&lt;/ref&gt;  == reception during antiquity == === achilles in greek tragedy === {{main article|achilleis (trilogy)}}  the [[tragedy|greek tragedian]] [[aeschylus]] wrote a trilogy of plays about achilles, given the title ''achilleis'' by modern scholars. the tragedies relate the deeds of achilles during the trojan war, including his defeat of [[hector]] and eventual death when an arrow shot by [[paris (mythology)|paris]] and guided by [[apollo]] punctures his heel. extant fragments of the ''achilleis'' and other aeschylean fragments have been assembled to produce a workable modern play. the first part of the ''achilleis'' trilogy, ''the myrmidons'', focused on the relationship between achilles and chorus, who represent the achaean army and try to convince achilles to give up his quarrel with agamemnon; only a few lines survive today.&lt;ref&gt;pantelis michelakis, ''achilles in greek tragedy'', 2002, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; in plato's ''symposium'', phaedrus points out that aeschylus portrayed achilles as the lover and patroclus as the beloved; phaedrus argues that this is incorrect because achilles, being the younger and more beautiful of the two, was the beloved, who loved his lover so much that he chose to die to revenge him.&lt;ref&gt;plato, ''symposium'', translated benjamin jowett, dover thrift editions, page 8&lt;/ref&gt;  the tragedian [[sophocles]] also wrote ''the lovers of achilles'', a play with achilles as the main character. only a few fragments survive.&lt;ref&gt;s. radt.

euripides refers to achilles in a bitter or ironic tone in ''[[hecuba (play)|hecuba]]'', ''[[electra (euripides)|electra]]'', and ''[[iphigenia in aulis]]''.&lt;ref name="latacz 2010"&gt;latacz 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

in doing so, he preserved the [[union (american civil war)|union]], paved the way to abolition of slavery, strengthened the federal government, and modernized the economy.  born in [[hodgenville, kentucky]], lincoln grew up on the [[american frontier|western frontier]] in [[kentucky]] and [[indiana]]. largely self-educated, he became a lawyer in [[illinois]], a [[whig party (united states)|whig party leader]], and was elected to the [[illinois house of representatives]], in which he served for eight years. elected to the [[united states house of representatives]] in 1846, lincoln promoted rapid modernization of the economy through banks, tariffs, and railroads. because he had originally agreed not to run for a second term in congress, and because his opposition to the [[mexican&#x2013;american war]] was unpopular among illinois voters, lincoln returned to [[springfield, illinois|springfield]] and resumed his successful law practice. reentering politics in 1854, he became a leader in building the new [[history of the united states republican party|republican party]], which had a statewide majority in illinois. in 1858, while taking part in a [[lincoln&#x2013;douglas debates|series of highly publicized debates]] with his opponent and rival, democrat [[stephen a. douglas]], lincoln spoke out against the expansion of slavery, but lost the u.s. senate race to douglas. in 1860, lincoln secured the republican party presidential nomination as a moderate from a swing state, by being the second choice of a grand majority of convention delegates whose first choices, due to factionalism, could not garner enough votes to win. though he gained very little support in the slaveholding states of the south, he swept the north and was [[united states presidential election, 1860|elected president in 1860]].  lincoln's victory prompted seven southern slave states to form the [[confederate states of america]] before he moved into the [[white house]]&#x2014;no compromise or reconciliation was found regarding slavery and secession. subsequently, on april 12, 1861, a confederate attack on [[fort sumter]] inspired the north to enthusiastically rally behind the [[union (american civil war)|union]]. as the leader of the moderate faction of the republican party, lincoln confronted radical republicans, who demanded harsher treatment of the south; [[war democrats]], who called for more compromise; anti-war democrats (called [[copperhead (politics)|copperheads]]), who despised him; and irreconcilable secessionists, who plotted his assassination.   politically, lincoln fought back by pitting his opponents against each other, by carefully planned political [[patronage]], and by appealing to the american people with his powers of oratory.&lt;ref&gt;randall (1947), pp. 65&#x2013;87.&lt;/ref&gt; his [[gettysburg address]] became an iconic endorsement of the principles of nationalism, republicanism, equal rights, liberty, and democracy. lincoln initially concentrated on the military and political dimensions of the war. his primary goal was to reunite the nation. he suspended [[habeas corpus]], leading to the controversial ''[[ex parte merryman]]'' decision, and he averted potential british intervention in the war by defusing the [[trent affair|''trent'' affair]] in late 1861.   lincoln closely supervised the war effort, especially the selection of top generals, including his most successful general, [[ulysses s. grant]]. he also made major decisions on union war strategy, including a [[union blockade|naval blockade]] that shut down the south's normal trade, moves to take control of kentucky and tennessee, and using gunboats to gain control of the southern river system. lincoln tried repeatedly to capture the confederate capital at [[richmond, virginia|richmond]]; each time a general failed, lincoln substituted another, until finally grant succeeded. as the war progressed, his complex moves toward ending slavery included the [[emancipation proclamation]] of 1863; lincoln used the u.s. army to protect escaped slaves, encouraged the [[border states (american civil war)|border states]] to outlaw slavery, and pushed through congress the [[thirteenth amendment to the united states constitution]], which permanently outlawed slavery.  an exceptionally astute politician deeply involved with power issues in each state, lincoln reached out to the war democrats and managed his own re-election campaign in the [[united states presidential election, 1864|1864 presidential election]]. anticipating the war's conclusion, lincoln pushed a moderate view of [[reconstruction era of the united states|reconstruction]], seeking to reunite the nation speedily through a policy of generous reconciliation in the face of lingering and bitter divisiveness. on april 14, 1865, five days after the surrender of confederate commanding general [[robert e. lee]], lincoln was assassinated by confederate sympathizer [[john wilkes booth]] and died the next day. lincoln has been consistently [[historical rankings of presidents of the united states#scholar survey results|ranked]] both by scholars&lt;ref name="ranking our presidents"&gt;[http://history-world.org/pres.pdf "ranking our presidents"]. james lindgren. november 16, 2000. international world history project.&lt;/ref&gt;

in the early 1850s, lincoln supported efforts for sectional mediation, and his 1852 eulogy for henry clay focused on the latter's support for gradual emancipation and opposition to "both extremes" on the slavery issue.&lt;ref&gt;white, pp. 182&#x2013;185.&lt;/ref&gt; as the 1850s progressed, the debate over slavery in the [[nebraska territory]] and [[kansas territory]] became particularly acrimonious, and senator [[stephen a. douglas]] of illinois proposed [[popular sovereignty in the united states#emergence of the term "popular sovereignty" and its pejorative connotation|popular sovereignty]] as a compromise measure; the proposal would take the issue of slavery out of the hands of congress by allowing the people of each territory to decide the status of slavery themselves. the proposal alarmed many northerners, who hoped to stop the spread of slavery into the territories. despite this northern opposition, douglas's [[kansas-nebraska act]] narrowly passed congress in may 1854.&lt;ref&gt;white, pp. 188&#x2013;190.&lt;/ref&gt;

lincoln resisted early attempts to recruit him to the new party, fearing that it would serve as a platform for extreme abolitionists.&lt;ref&gt;white, pp. 203&#x2013;204.&lt;/ref&gt; lincoln also still hoped to rejuvenate the ailing whig party, though he bemoaned his party's growing closeness with the nativist [[know nothing]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;white, pp. 191&#x2013;194.&lt;/ref&gt;  lincoln was elected to the illinois legislature as whig.  in the aftermath of the 1854 elections, which showed the power and popularity of the movement opposed to the kansas-nebraska act, lincoln declined to take his seat and instead sought election to the united states senate.&lt;ref&gt;white, pp. 204&#x2013;205.&lt;/ref&gt; at that time, senators were elected by the state legislature.&lt;ref&gt;oates, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; after leading in the first six rounds of voting, but unable to obtain a majority, lincoln instructed his backers to vote for [[lyman trumbull]]. trumbull was an antislavery democrat, and had received few votes in the earlier ballots; his supporters, also antislavery democrats, had vowed not to support any whig. lincoln's decision to withdraw enabled his whig supporters and trumbull's antislavery democrats to combine and defeat the mainstream democratic candidate, [[joel aldrich matteson]].&lt;ref&gt;white, pp. 205&#x2013;208.&lt;/ref&gt;  in part due to the ongoing [[bleeding kansas|violent political confrontations in the kansas]], opposition to the kansas-nebraska act remained strong in illinois and throughout the north. as the [[united states elections, 1856|1856 elections]] approached, lincoln abandoned the defunct whig party in favor of the republicans. he attended the may 1856 [[bloomington convention]], which formally established the [[illinois republican party]]. the convention platform asserted that congress had the right to regulate slavery in the territories and called for the immediate admission of kansas as a free state. lincoln gave the [[lincoln's lost speech|final speech]] of the convention, in which he endorsed the party platform and called for the preservation of the union.&lt;ref&gt;white, pp. 216&#x2013;221.&lt;/ref&gt; at the june [[1856 republican national convention]], lincoln received significant support on the vice presidential ballot, though the party nominated a ticket of [[john c. fr&#xe9;mont]] and [[william dayton]]. lincoln strongly supported the republican ticket, campaigning for the party throughout illinois. the democrats nominated former ambassador [[james buchanan]], who had been out of the country since 1853 and thus had avoided the debate over slavery in the territories, while the know nothings nominated former whig president [[millard fillmore]].&lt;ref&gt;white, pp. 224&#x2013;228.&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1856 elections, buchanan defeated both his challengers, but fr&#xe9;mont won several northern states and republican [[william henry bissell]] won election as governor of illinois. though lincoln did not himself win office, his vigorous campaigning had made him the leading republican in illinois.&lt;ref&gt;white, pp. 229&#x2013;230.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[eric foner]] (2010) contrasts the abolitionists and anti-slavery radical republicans of the northeast who saw slavery as a sin, with the conservative republicans who thought it was bad because it hurt white people and blocked progress. foner argues that lincoln was a moderate in the middle, opposing slavery primarily because it violated the [[republicanism in the united states|republicanism principles]] of the [[founding fathers]], especially the equality of all men and democratic self-government as expressed in the [[united states declaration of independence|declaration of independence]].&lt;ref&gt;foner (2010), pp. 84&#x2013;88.&lt;/ref&gt;

lincoln denounced the decision, alleging it was the product of a conspiracy of democrats to support the [[slave power]].&lt;ref&gt;zarefsky, pp. 69&#x2013;110.&lt;/ref&gt; lincoln argued, "the authors of the declaration of independence never intended 'to say all were equal in color, size, intellect, moral developments, or social capacity', but they 'did consider all men created equal&#x2014;equal in certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness'."&lt;ref&gt;jaffa, pp. 299&#x2013;300.&lt;/ref&gt;

 accepting the nomination, lincoln delivered his [[lincoln's house divided speech|house divided speech]], drawing on {{bibleverse|mark|3:25|9}}, "a house divided against itself cannot stand. i believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. i do not expect the union to be dissolved&#x2014;i do not expect the house to fall&#x2014;but i do expect it will cease to be divided. it will become all one thing, or all the other."&lt;ref&gt;white, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt; the speech created an evocative image of the danger of disunion caused by the slavery debate, and rallied republicans across the north.&lt;ref&gt;harris, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; the stage was then set for the campaign for statewide election of the illinois legislature which would, in turn, select lincoln or douglas as its u.s. senator.&lt;ref&gt;donald (1996), p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

 the senate campaign featured the seven [[lincoln&#x2013;douglas debates]] of 1858, the most famous political debates in american history.&lt;ref&gt;mcpherson (1993), p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; the principals stood in stark contrast both physically and politically. lincoln warned that "[[the slave power]]" was threatening the values of republicanism, and accused douglas of distorting the values of the founding fathers that [[all men are created equal]], while douglas emphasized his [[freeport doctrine]], that local settlers were free to choose whether to allow slavery or not, and accused lincoln of having joined the abolitionists.&lt;ref&gt;donald (1996), pp. 214&#x2013;224.&lt;/ref&gt; the debates had an atmosphere of a prize fight and drew crowds in the thousands. lincoln stated douglas' popular sovereignty theory was a threat to the nation's morality and that douglas represented a conspiracy to extend slavery to free states. douglas said that lincoln was defying the authority of the u.s. supreme court and the ''dred scott'' decision.&lt;ref&gt;donald (1996), p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt;  though the republican legislative candidates won more popular votes, the democrats won more seats, and the legislature re-elected douglas to the senate. despite the bitterness of the defeat for lincoln, his articulation of the issues gave him a national political reputation.&lt;ref&gt;carwardine (2003), pp. 89&#x2013;90.&lt;/ref&gt; in may 1859, lincoln purchased the ''illinois staats-anzeiger'', a german-language newspaper which was consistently supportive; most of the state's 130,000 german americans voted democratic but there was republican support that a german-language paper could mobilize.&lt;ref&gt;donald (1996), pp. 242, 412.&lt;/ref&gt; in the aftermath of the 1858 election, newspapers frequently mentioned lincoln as a potential republican presidential candidate in 1860, with [[william h. seward]], [[salmon p. chase]], [[edward bates]], and [[simon cameron]] looming as rivals for the nomination. while lincoln was popular in the midwest, he lacked support in the northeast, and was unsure as to whether he should seek the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;white, pp. 291&#x2013;293.&lt;/ref&gt; in january 1860, lincoln told a group of political allies that he would accept the 1860 presidential nomination if offered, and in the following months several local papers endorsed lincoln for president.&lt;ref&gt;white, pp. 307&#x2013;308.&lt;/ref&gt;  on february 27, 1860, new york party leaders invited lincoln to give a [[cooper union speech|speech at cooper union]] to a group of powerful republicans. lincoln argued that the founding fathers had little use for popular sovereignty and had repeatedly sought to restrict slavery. lincoln insisted the moral foundation of the republicans required opposition to slavery, and rejected any "groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong".&lt;ref&gt;jaffa, p. 473.&lt;/ref&gt; despite his inelegant appearance&#x2014;many in the audience thought him awkward and even ugly&lt;ref&gt;holzer, pp. 108&#x2013;111.&lt;/ref&gt;&#x2014;lincoln demonstrated an intellectual leadership that brought him into the front ranks of the party and into contention for the republican presidential nomination. journalist [[noah brooks]] reported, "no man ever before made such an impression on his first appeal to a new york audience."&lt;ref&gt;carwardine (2003), p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;holzer, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;  historian [[david herbert donald|donald]] described the speech as a "superb political move for an unannounced candidate, to appear in one rival's (seward) own state at an event sponsored by the second rival's (chase) loyalists, while not mentioning either by name during its delivery".&lt;ref&gt;donald (1996), p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt;

 most republicans agreed with lincoln that the north was the aggrieved party, as the slave power tightened its grasp on the national government with the ''dred scott'' decision and the presidency of james buchanan. throughout the 1850s, lincoln doubted the prospects of civil war, and his supporters rejected claims that his election would incite secession.&lt;ref&gt;boritt (1994), pp. 10, 13, 18.&lt;/ref&gt; meanwhile, douglas was selected as the candidate of the northern democrats. delegates from 11 slave states walked out of the [[1860 democratic national convention|democratic convention]], disagreeing with douglas' position on popular sovereignty, and ultimately selected incumbent vice president [[john c. breckinridge]] as their candidate.&lt;ref&gt;donald (1996), p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; a group of former whigs and know nothings formed the [[constitutional union party (united states)|constitutional union party]] and nominated [[john bell (tennessee politician)|john bell]] of tennessee. lincoln and douglas would compete for votes in the north, while bell and breckinridge primarily found support in the south.&lt;ref name="white, pp. 247&#x2013;248"/&gt;

historian [[donald, david herbert|donald]] concludes that, "his repeated efforts to avoid collision in the months between inauguration and the firing on ft. sumter showed he adhered to his vow not to be the first to shed fraternal blood. but he also vowed not to surrender the forts. the only resolution of these contradictory positions was for the confederates to fire the first shot; they did just that."&lt;ref&gt;donald (1996), p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt;  on april 15, lincoln called on all the states to send detachments totaling 75,000 troops to recapture forts, protect washington, and "preserve the union", which, in his view, still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states. this call forced the states to choose sides. virginia declared its secession and was rewarded with the confederate capital, despite the exposed position of [[richmond, virginia|richmond]] so close to union lines. north carolina, tennessee, and arkansas also voted for secession over the next two months. secession sentiment was strong in missouri and maryland, but did not prevail;

 ===war strategy=== after the [[battle of fort sumter]], lincoln realized the importance of taking immediate executive control of the war and making an overall strategy to put down the rebellion. lincoln encountered an unprecedented political and military crisis, and he responded as [[commander-in-chief]], using unprecedented powers. he expanded his war powers, and imposed a blockade on all the confederate shipping ports, disbursed funds before appropriation by congress, and after suspending ''habeas corpus'', arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected confederate sympathizers. lincoln was supported by congress and the northern public for these actions. in addition, lincoln had to contend with reinforcing strong union sympathies in the border slave states and keeping the war from becoming an international conflict.&lt;ref&gt;donald (1996), pp. 303&#x2013;304;

neither militarily necessary nor legal.&lt;ref&gt;donald (1996), pp. 314&#x2013;317.&lt;/ref&gt; after lincoln acted, union enlistments from maryland, kentucky, and missouri increased by over 40,000 troops.&lt;ref&gt;carwardine (2003), p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

the [[trent affair]] of late 1861 threatened war with great britain. the u.s. navy had illegally intercepted a british mail ship, the ''trent'', on the high seas and seized two confederate envoys; britain protested vehemently while the u.s. cheered. lincoln ended the crisis by releasing the two diplomats. biographer [[james g. randall]] has dissected lincoln's successful techniques: :his restraint, his avoidance of any outward expression of truculence, his early softening of state department's attitude toward britain, his deference toward seward and sumner, his withholding of his own paper prepared for the occasion, his readiness to arbitrate, his golden silence in addressing congress, his shrewdness in recognizing that war must be averted, and his clear perception that a point could be clinched for america's true position at the same time that full satisfaction was given to a friendly country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=james garfield randall|title=lincoln the president: springfield to gettysburg|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vi8aaqaaiaaj|year=1946|page=50|access-date=may 16, 2016}} quoted in kevin peraino, ''lincoln in the world: the making of a statesman and the dawn of american power'' (2013) pp 160&#x2013;61.&lt;/ref&gt;  lincoln painstakingly monitored the telegraphic reports coming into the [[united states war department|war department]] headquarters.  he kept close tabs on all phases of the military effort, consulted with governors, and selected generals based on their past success (as well as their state and party). in january 1862, after many complaints of inefficiency and profiteering in the war department, lincoln replaced [[simon cameron]] with [[edwin stanton]] as [[united states secretary of war|war secretary]]. stanton was a staunchly unionist pro-business conservative democrat who moved toward the radical republican faction. nevertheless, he worked more often and more closely with lincoln than any other senior official.

 in terms of war strategy, lincoln articulated two priorities: to ensure that washington was well-defended, and to conduct an aggressive war effort that would satisfy the demand in the north for prompt, decisive victory; major northern newspaper editors expected victory within 90 days.&lt;ref&gt;donald (1996), pp. 295&#x2013;296.&lt;/ref&gt; twice a week, lincoln would meet with his cabinet in the afternoon, and occasionally mary lincoln would force him to take a carriage ride because she was concerned he was working too hard.&lt;ref&gt;donald (1996), pp. 391&#x2013;392.&lt;/ref&gt;

mcclellan, a young west point graduate, railroad executive, and pennsylvania democrat, took several months to plan and attempt his [[peninsula campaign]], longer than lincoln wanted. the campaign's objective was to capture richmond by moving the [[army of the potomac]] by boat to the peninsula and then overland to the confederate capital. mcclellan's repeated delays frustrated lincoln and congress, as did his position that no troops were needed to defend washington. lincoln insisted on holding some of mcclellan's troops in defense of the capital; mcclellan, who consistently overestimated the strength of confederate troops, blamed this decision for the ultimate failure of the peninsula campaign.&lt;ref&gt;donald (1996), pp. 349&#x2013;352.&lt;/ref&gt;

the ensuing union victory was among the bloodiest in american history, but it enabled lincoln to announce that he would issue an [[emancipation proclamation]] in january. having composed the proclamation some time earlier, lincoln had waited for a military victory to publish it to avoid it being perceived as the product of desperation.&lt;ref&gt;goodwin, p. 481.&lt;/ref&gt;  mcclellan then resisted the president's demand that he pursue lee's retreating and exposed army, while his counterpart general [[don carlos buell]] likewise refused orders to move the [[army of the ohio]] against rebel forces in eastern tennessee. as a result, lincoln replaced buell with [[william rosecrans]]; and, after the 1862 midterm elections, he replaced mcclellan with republican [[ambrose burnside]]. both of these replacements were political moderates and prospectively more supportive of the commander-in-chief.&lt;ref&gt;donald (1996), pp. 389&#x2013;390.&lt;/ref&gt;

 in the spring of 1863, lincoln was optimistic about upcoming military campaigns to the point of thinking the end of the war could be near if a string of victories could be put together; these plans included hooker's attack on lee north of richmond, rosecrans' on chattanooga, grant's on vicksburg, and a naval assault on charleston.&lt;ref&gt;donald (1996), pp. 422&#x2013;423.&lt;/ref&gt;

after the battle of gettysburg, lincoln clearly understood that his military decisions would be more effectively carried out by conveying his orders through his war secretary or his general-in-chief on to his generals, who resented his civilian interference with their own plans. even so, he often continued to give detailed directions to his generals as commander-in-chief.&lt;ref&gt;donald (1996), p. 446.&lt;/ref&gt;

 on june 19, 1862, endorsed by lincoln, congress passed an act banning slavery on all federal territory. in july, the [[confiscation act of 1862]] was passed, which set up court procedures that could free the slaves of anyone convicted of aiding the rebellion. although lincoln believed it was not within congress's power to free the slaves within the states, he approved the bill in deference to the legislature. he felt such action could only be taken by the commander-in-chief using war powers granted to the president by the constitution, and lincoln was planning to take that action. in that month, lincoln discussed a draft of the emancipation proclamation with his cabinet. in it, he stated that "as a fit and necessary military measure, on january 1, 1863, all persons held as slaves in the confederate states will thenceforward, and forever, be free".&lt;ref&gt;donald (1996), pp. 364&#x2013;365.&lt;/ref&gt;  privately, lincoln concluded at this point that the slave base of the confederacy had to be eliminated. however copperheads argued that emancipation was a stumbling block to peace and reunification. republican editor [[horace greeley]] of the highly influential ''new york tribune'' fell for the ploy,&lt;ref&gt;mcpherson (1992), p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; and lincoln refuted it directly in a shrewd letter of august 22, 1862. although he said he personally wished all men could be free, lincoln stated that the primary goal of his actions as the u.s. president (he used the first person pronoun and explicitly refers to his "official duty") was that of preserving the union:&lt;ref&gt;guelzo (2004), pp. 147&#x2013;153.&lt;/ref&gt;

for some time, lincoln continued earlier plans to set up [[abraham lincoln on slavery#colonization|colonies]] for the newly freed slaves. he commented favorably on colonization in the emancipation proclamation, but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed.&lt;ref&gt;donald (1996), p. 408.&lt;/ref&gt;

 enlisting former slaves in the military was official government policy after the issuance of the emancipation proclamation. by the spring of 1863, lincoln was ready to recruit black troops in more than token numbers. in a letter to [[andrew johnson]], the military governor of tennessee, encouraging him to lead the way in raising black troops, lincoln wrote, "the bare sight of 50,000 armed and drilled black soldiers on the banks of the mississippi would end the rebellion at once".&lt;ref&gt;donald (1996), pp. 430&#x2013;431.&lt;/ref&gt;

 in 272 words, and three minutes, lincoln asserted the nation was born not in 1789, but in 1776, "conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal". he defined the war as an effort dedicated to these principles of liberty and equality for all. the emancipation of slaves was now part of the national war effort. he declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain, that slavery would end as a result of the losses, and the future of democracy in the world would be assured, that "government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth". lincoln concluded that the civil war had a profound objective: a new birth of freedom in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;donald (1996), pp. 460&#x2013;466.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;wills, pp. 20, 27, 105, 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

 nevertheless, lincoln was concerned that grant might be considering a candidacy for president in 1864, as mcclellan was. lincoln arranged for an intermediary to make inquiry into grant's political intentions, and being assured that he had none, submitted to the senate grant's promotion to commander of the union army. he obtained congress's consent to reinstate for grant the rank of lieutenant general, which no officer had held since george washington.&lt;ref&gt;donald (1996), pp. 490&#x2013;492.&lt;/ref&gt;  grant waged his bloody [[overland campaign]] in 1864. this is often characterized as a [[attrition warfare|war of attrition]], given high union losses at battles such as the [[battle of the wilderness]] and [[battle of cold harbor|cold harbor]]. even though they had the advantage of fighting on the defensive, the confederate forces had "almost as high a percentage of casualties as the union forces".&lt;ref&gt;mcpherson (2009), p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

 the confederacy lacked reinforcements, so lee's army shrank with every costly battle. grant's army moved south, crossed the [[james river]], forcing a [[siege of petersburg|siege]] and trench warfare outside [[petersburg, virginia]]. lincoln then made an extended visit to grant's headquarters at city point, virginia. this allowed the president to confer in person with grant and william tecumseh sherman about the hostilities, as sherman coincidentally managed a hasty visit to grant from his position in north carolina.&lt;ref name="whitehousehistory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehousehistory.org/whha_about/whitehouse_collection/whitehouse_collection-art-06.html |title=the peacemakers |publisher=the white house historical association |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/62a8j9joa?url=http://www.whitehousehistory.org/whha_about/whitehouse_collection/whitehouse_collection-art-06.html |archivedate=october 20, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy |access-date=may 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

in keeping with that sentiment, lincoln led the moderates regarding reconstruction policy, and was opposed by the radical republicans, under rep. [[thaddeus stevens]], sen. [[charles sumner]] and sen. [[benjamin wade]], political allies of the president on other issues. determined to find a course that would reunite the nation and not alienate the south, lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held throughout the war. his [[ten percent plan|amnesty proclamation]] of december 8, 1863, offered pardons to those who had not held a confederate civil office, had not mistreated union prisoners, and would sign an oath of allegiance.&lt;ref&gt;donald (1996), pp. 471&#x2013;472.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[file:lincoln and johnsond.jpg|alt=cartoon of lincoln and johnson attempting to stitch up the broken union|thumb|a political cartoon of vice president andrew johnson (a former tailor) and lincoln, 1865, entitled ''the 'rail splitter' at work repairing the union''. the caption reads (johnson): "take it quietly uncle abe and i will draw it closer than ever." (lincoln): "a few more stitches andy and the good old union will be mended."]]  as southern states were subdued, critical decisions had to be made as to their leadership while their administrations were re-formed. of special importance were tennessee and arkansas, where lincoln appointed generals [[andrew johnson#general|andrew johnson]] and [[frederick steele]] as military governors, respectively. in louisiana, lincoln ordered general [[nathaniel p. banks]] to promote a plan that would restore statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed to it. lincoln's democratic opponents seized on these appointments to accuse him of using the military to ensure his and the republicans' political aspirations. on the other hand, the radicals denounced his policy as too lenient, and passed their own plan, the [[wade-davis bill]], in 1864. when lincoln vetoed the bill, the radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from louisiana, arkansas, and tennessee.&lt;ref&gt;donald (1996), pp. 485&#x2013;486.&lt;/ref&gt;  lincoln's appointments were designed to keep both the moderate and radical factions in harness. to fill chief justice taney's seat on the supreme court, he named the choice of the radicals, salmon p. chase, who lincoln believed would uphold the emancipation and paper money policies.&lt;ref&gt;nevins, ''ordeal of the union'', vol iv., p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;  after implementing the emancipation proclamation, which did not apply to every state, lincoln increased pressure on congress to outlaw slavery throughout the entire nation with a constitutional amendment. lincoln declared that such an amendment would "clinch the whole matter".&lt;ref&gt;donald (1996), p. 561.&lt;/ref&gt; by december 1863, a proposed constitutional amendment that would outlaw slavery was brought to congress for passage. this first attempt at an amendment failed to pass, falling short of the required two-thirds majority on june 15, 1864, in the house of representatives. passage of the proposed amendment became part of the republican/unionist platform in the election of 1864. after a long debate in the house, a second attempt passed congress on january 31, 1865, and was sent to the state legislatures for ratification.&lt;ref&gt;donald (1996), pp. 562&#x2013;563.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/house-passes-the-13th-amendment |title=house passes the 13th amendment &#x2013;

 as the war drew to a close, lincoln's presidential reconstruction for the south was in flux; having believed the federal government had limited responsibility to the millions of freedmen. he signed into law senator charles sumner's [[freedmen's bureau]] bill that set up a temporary federal agency designed to meet the immediate material needs of former slaves. the law assigned land for a lease of three years with the ability to purchase title for the freedmen. lincoln stated that his louisiana plan did not apply to all states under reconstruction. shortly before his assassination, lincoln announced he had a new plan for southern reconstruction. discussions with his cabinet revealed lincoln planned short-term military control over southern states, until readmission under the control of southern unionists.&lt;ref&gt;carwardine (2003), pp. 242&#x2013;243.&lt;/ref&gt;  historians agree that it is impossible to predict exactly what lincoln would have done about reconstruction if he had lived, but they make projections based on his known policy positions and political acumen. lincoln biographers [[james g. randall]] and [[richard current]], according to david lincove, argue that: :it is likely that had he lived, lincoln would have followed a policy similar to johnson's, that he would have clashed with congressional radicals, that he would have produced a better result for the freedmen than occurred, and that his political skills would have helped him avoid johnson's mistakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=lincove|first=david a.|title=reconstruction in the united states: an annotated bibliography|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3eqct7-dpi0c&amp;pg=pa80|year= 2000|publisher=greenwood|page=80|access-date=june 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[eric foner]] argues that: :unlike sumner and other radicals, lincoln did not see reconstruction as an opportunity for a sweeping political and social revolution beyond emancipation. he had long made clear his opposition to the confiscation and redistribution of land. he believed, as most republicans did in april 1865, that the voting requirements should be determined by the states. he assumed that political control in the south would pass to white unionists, reluctant secessionists, and forward-looking former confederates. but time and again during the war, lincoln, after initial opposition, had come to embrace positions first advanced by abolitionists and radical republicans.&amp;nbsp;... lincoln undoubtedly would have listened carefully to the outcry for further protection for the former slaves&amp;nbsp;... it is entirely plausible to imagine lincoln and congress agreeing on a reconstruction policy that encompassed federal protection for basic civil rights plus limited black suffrage, along the lines lincoln proposed just before his death."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=foner|first=eric|title=the fiery trial: abraham lincoln and american slavery|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4b8m7cv3wtic&amp;pg=pa335|year=2010|publisher=w. w. norton|pages=334&#x2013;36|access-date=june 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 in recent years, historians such as harry jaffa, herman belz, john diggins, vernon burton and eric foner have stressed lincoln's redefinition of ''republican values''. as early as the 1850s, a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the constitution, lincoln redirected emphasis to the declaration of independence as the foundation of american political values&#x2014;what he called the "sheet anchor" of republicanism.&lt;ref&gt;jaffa, p. 399.&lt;/ref&gt; the declaration's emphasis on freedom and equality for all, in contrast to the constitution's tolerance of slavery, shifted the debate. as diggins concludes regarding the highly influential cooper union speech of early 1860, "lincoln presented americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself."&lt;ref&gt;diggins, p. 307.&lt;/ref&gt; his position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism, rather than its legalisms.&lt;ref&gt;foner (2010), p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; nevertheless, in 1861, lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms (the constitution was a contract, and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree), and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a republican form of government in every state.&lt;ref&gt;jaffa, p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt; burton (2008) argues that lincoln's republicanism was taken up by the freedmen as they were emancipated.&lt;ref&gt;orville vernon burton, ''the age of lincoln'' (2008) p 243&lt;/ref&gt;  in march 1861, in [[lincoln's first inaugural address]], he explored the nature of democracy. he denounced secession as anarchy, and explained that majority rule had to be balanced by constitutional restraints in the american system. he said "a majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations, and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free people."&lt;ref&gt;belz (1998), p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; {{clear}}  ===other enactments=== lincoln adhered to the whig theory of the presidency, which gave congress primary responsibility for writing the laws while the executive enforced them. lincoln vetoed only four bills passed by congress; the only important one was the wade-davis bill with its harsh program of reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;donald (2001), p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; he signed the [[homestead act]] in 1862, making millions of acres of government-held land in the west available for purchase at very low cost. the [[morrill land-grant colleges act]], also signed in 1862, provided government grants for agricultural colleges in each state. the [[pacific railway acts]] of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the united states' [[first transcontinental railroad]], which was completed in 1869.&lt;ref&gt;paludan, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; the passage of the homestead act and the pacific railway acts was made possible by the absence of southern congressmen and senators who had opposed the measures in the 1850s.&lt;ref&gt;mcpherson (1993), pp. 450&#x2013;452.&lt;/ref&gt;

he ordered the military to seize the two papers. the seizure lasted for two days.&lt;ref&gt;donald (1996), pp. 501&#x2013;502.&lt;/ref&gt;  lincoln is largely responsible for the institution of the [[thanksgiving (united states)|thanksgiving holiday]] in the united states.&lt;ref name="donald 1996, p. 471"&gt;donald (1996), p. 471.&lt;/ref&gt;

william c. harris found that lincoln's "reverence for the founding fathers, the constitution, the laws under it, and the preservation of the republic and its institutions undergirded and strengthened his conservatism".&lt;ref&gt;harris, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; james g. randall emphasizes his tolerance and especially his moderation "in his preference for orderly progress, his distrust of dangerous agitation, and his reluctance toward ill digested schemes of reform". randall concludes that, "he was conservative in his complete avoidance of that type of so-called 'radicalism' which involved abuse of the south, hatred for the slaveholder, thirst for vengeance, partisan plotting, and ungenerous demands that southern institutions be transformed overnight by outsiders."&lt;ref&gt;randall (1947), p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;  by the late 1960s, some african american intellectuals led by  [[lerone bennett jr.]], rejected lincoln's role as the great emancipator.&lt;ref&gt;zilversmit, "lincoln and the problem of race: a decade of interpretations" (1980) pp. 22&#x2013;24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;john m. barr, "holding up a flawed mirror to the american soul: abraham lincoln in the writings of lerone bennett jr.," ''journal of the abraham lincoln association'' 35 (winter 2014), 43&#x2013;65&lt;/ref&gt; bennett won wide attention when he called lincoln a white supremacist in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;bennett, pp. 35&#x2013;42.&lt;/ref&gt; he noted that lincoln used ethnic slurs and told jokes that ridiculed blacks. bennett argued that lincoln opposed social equality, and proposed [[american colonization society|sending freed slaves]] to another country. defenders, such as authors dirck and cashin, retorted that he was not as bad as most politicians of his day;&lt;ref&gt;dirck (2008), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; and that he was a "moral visionary" who deftly advanced the abolitionist cause, as fast as politically possible.&lt;ref&gt;striner, pp. 2&#x2013;4.&lt;/ref&gt; the emphasis shifted away from lincoln-the-emancipator to an argument that blacks had freed themselves from slavery, or at least were responsible for pressuring the government on emancipation.&lt;ref&gt;cashin, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;kelley &amp;

on the other hand, donald opined in his 1996 biography that lincoln was distinctly endowed with the personality trait of [[negative capability]], defined by the poet [[john keats]] and attributed to extraordinary leaders who were "content in the midst of uncertainties and doubts, and not compelled toward fact or reason".&lt;ref&gt;donald (1996), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

 plato believed that deduction would simply follow from [[premise]]s, hence he focused on maintaining solid premises so that the [[logical consequence|conclusion]] would logically follow. consequently, plato realized that a method for obtaining conclusions would be most beneficial. he never succeeded in devising such a method, but his best attempt was published in his book ''[[sophist (dialogue)|sophist]]'', where he introduced his division method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=rose | first=lynn e. | title=aristotle's syllogistic | publisher=charles c thomas publisher | date=1968 | location=springfield}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ====analytics and the ''organon''==== {{main article|organon}} what we today call ''aristotelian logic'', aristotle himself would have labeled "analytics". the term "logic" he reserved to mean ''dialectics''. most of aristotle's work is probably not in its original form, because it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers. the logical works of aristotle were compiled into six books in about the early 1st century ce:  # ''categories'' # ''on interpretation'' # ''prior analytics'' # ''posterior analytics'' # ''topics'' # ''on sophistical refutations''  the order of the books (or the teachings from which they are composed) is not certain, but this list was derived from analysis of aristotle's writings. it goes from the basics, the analysis of simple terms in the ''categories,'' the analysis of propositions and their elementary relations in ''on interpretation'', to the study of more complex forms, namely, syllogisms (in the ''analytics'') and dialectics (in the ''topics'' and ''sophistical refutations''). the first three treatises form the core of the logical theory ''stricto sensu'': the grammar of the language of logic and the correct rules of reasoning. there is one volume of aristotle's concerning logic not found in the ''organon'', namely the fourth book of ''metaphysics.''&lt;ref name="boche&#x144;ski, 1951"/&gt;

 in aristotle's terminology, "natural philosophy" is a branch of philosophy examining the phenomena of the natural world, and includes fields that would be regarded today as physics, biology and other natural sciences. in modern times, the scope of ''philosophy'' has become limited to more generic or abstract inquiries, such as ethics and metaphysics, in which logic plays a major role. today's philosophy tends to exclude empirical study of the natural world by means of the scientific method. in contrast, aristotle's philosophical endeavors encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry.  in the larger sense of the word, aristotle makes philosophy coextensive with reasoning, which he also would describe as "science". note, however, that his use of the term ''science'' carries a different meaning than that covered by the term "scientific method". for aristotle, "all science (''dianoia'') is either practical, poetical or theoretical" (''metaphysics'' 1025b25). by practical science, he means ethics and politics; by poetical science, he means the study of poetry and the other fine arts; by theoretical science, he means physics, mathematics and metaphysics.&lt;ref name="sep"/&gt;  if logic (or "analytics") is regarded as a study preliminary to philosophy, the divisions of aristotelian philosophy would consist of: (1) [[logic]]; (2) theoretical philosophy, including metaphysics, physics and mathematics; (3) practical philosophy and (4) poetical philosophy.  in the period between his two stays in athens, between his times at the academy and the lyceum, aristotle conducted most of the scientific thinking and research for which he is renowned today. in fact, most of aristotle's life was devoted to the study of the objects of natural science. aristotle's metaphysics contains observations on the nature of numbers but he made no original contributions to mathematics. he did, however, perform [[original research]] in the natural sciences, e.g., botany, zoology, physics, astronomy, chemistry, meteorology, and several other sciences.  aristotle's writings on science are largely qualitative, as opposed to quantitative. beginning in the 16th century, scientists began applying mathematics to the physical sciences, and aristotle's work in this area was deemed hopelessly inadequate. his failings were largely due to the absence of concepts like mass, velocity, force and temperature. he had a conception of speed and temperature, but no quantitative understanding of them, which was partly due to the absence of basic experimental devices, like clocks and thermometers.  his writings provide an account of many scientific observations, a mixture of precocious accuracy and curious errors. for example, in his ''[[history of animals]]'' he claimed that human males have more teeth than females.&lt;ref&gt;aristotle, ''history of animals'', 2.3.&lt;/ref&gt; in a similar vein, [[john philoponus]], and later [[galileo galilei|galileo]], showed by simple experiments that aristotle's theory that a heavier object falls faster than a lighter object is incorrect.&lt;ref name="sep"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/philoponus/#2.2 |title=stanford encyclopedia of philosophy |publisher=plato.stanford.edu |accessdate=26 april 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the other hand, aristotle refuted [[democritus]]'s claim that the [[milky way]] was made up of "those stars which are shaded by the earth from the sun's rays," pointing out (correctly, even if such reasoning was bound to be dismissed for a long time) that, given "current astronomical demonstrations" that "the size of the sun is greater than that of the earth and the distance of the stars from the earth many times greater than that of the sun, then&amp;nbsp;... the sun shines on all the stars and the earth screens none of them."&lt;ref&gt;aristotle, ''meteorology'' 1.8, trans. e.w. webster, rev. j. barnes.&lt;/ref&gt;  aristotle also had some scientific blind spots. he posited a [[geocentrism|geocentric cosmology]] that we may discern in selections of the ''metaphysics'', which was widely accepted up until the 16th century. from the 3rd century to the 16th century, the dominant view held that the earth was the rotational [[history of the center of the universe|center of the universe]].  because he was perhaps the philosopher most respected by european thinkers during and after the renaissance, these thinkers often took aristotle's erroneous positions as given, which held back science in this epoch.&lt;ref&gt;[[john burnet (classicist)|burnet, john]]. 1928. ''platonism'', berkeley: university of california press, pp. 61, 103&#x2013;04.&lt;/ref&gt; however, aristotle's scientific shortcomings should not mislead one into forgetting his great advances in the many scientific fields. for instance, he founded logic as a [[formal science]] and created foundations to biology that were not superseded for two millennia. moreover, he introduced the fundamental notion that nature is composed of things that change and that studying such changes can provide useful knowledge of underlying constants.  ===geology=== as quoted from [[w:charles lyell|charles lyell's]] ''[[principles of geology]]'':&lt;blockquote&gt; he [aristotle] refers to many examples of changes now constantly going on, and insists emphatically on the great results which they must produce in the lapse of ages. he instances particular cases of lakes that had dried up, and deserts that had at length become watered by rivers and fertilized. he points to the growth of the nilotic delta since the time of homer, to the shallowing of the [[palus maeotis]] within sixty years from his own time&amp;nbsp;... he alludes&amp;nbsp;... to the upheaving of one of the eolian islands, previous to a volcanic eruption. the changes of the earth, he says, are so slow in comparison to the duration of our lives, that they are overlooked; and the migrations of people after great catastrophes, and their removal to other regions, cause the event to be forgotten.  he says [12th chapter of his ''meteorics''] 'the distribution of land and sea in particular regions does not endure throughout all time, but it becomes sea in those parts where it was land, and again it becomes land where it was sea, and there is reason for thinking that these changes take place according to a certain system, and within a certain period.' the concluding observation is as follows: 'as time never fails, and the universe is eternal, neither the tanais, nor the nile, can have flowed for ever. the places where they rise were once dry, and there is a limit to their operations, but there is none to time. so also of all other rivers; they spring up and they perish; and the sea also continually deserts some lands and invades others the same tracts, therefore, of the earth are not some always sea, and others always continents, but every thing changes in the course of time.'&lt;ref&gt;[[q:charles lyell|charles lyell]], ''[https://archive.org/details/principlesgeolo01unkngoog principles of geology]'', 1832, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  ===physics=== {{main article|aristotelian physics}}  ====five elements==== {{main article|classical element}} aristotle proposed a fifth element, aether, in addition to the four proposed earlier by [[empedocles]]. * [[earth (classical element)|earth]], which is cold and dry; this corresponds to the modern idea of a solid. * [[water (classical element)|water]], which is cold and wet; this corresponds to the modern idea of a liquid. * [[air (classical element)|air]], which is hot and wet; this corresponds to the modern idea of a gas. * [[fire (classical element)|fire]], which is hot and dry; this corresponds to the modern ideas of [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] and heat. * [[aether (classical element)|aether]], which is the divine substance that makes up the [[celestial spheres|heavenly spheres]] and heavenly bodies (stars and planets).  each of the four earthly elements has its natural place. all that is earthly tends toward the center of the universe, i.e., the center of the earth. water tends toward a sphere surrounding the center. air tends toward a sphere surrounding the water sphere. fire tends toward the lunar sphere (in which the moon orbits). when elements are moved out of their natural place, they naturally move back towards it. this is "natural motion" &#x2013; motion requiring no extrinsic cause. so, for example, in water, earthy bodies sink while air bubbles rise up; in air, rain falls and flame rises. outside all the other spheres, the heavenly, fifth element, manifested in the stars and planets, moves in the perfection of circles.  ====motion==== {{main article|potentiality and actuality}} aristotle defined [[motion (physics)|motion]] as the actuality of a potentiality ''as such''.&lt;ref&gt;''physics'' 201a10&#x2013;11, 201a27&#x2013;29, 201b4&#x2013;5&lt;/ref&gt; aquinas suggested that the passage be understood literally; that motion can indeed be understood as the active fulfillment of a potential, as a transition toward a potentially possible state. because [[aristotle#substance, potentiality and actuality|actuality and potentiality]] are normally opposites in aristotle, other commentators either suggest that the wording which has come down to us is erroneous, or that the addition of the "as such" to the definition is critical to understanding it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=sachs|first=joe|title=aristotle: motion and its place in nature|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/aris-mot/ |work=internet encyclopedia of philosophy |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160411034200/http://www.iep.utm.edu/aris-mot/ |archivedate=11 april 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ====causality, the four causes==== &lt;!--linked from [[retrocausality]] and [[physics (aristotle)]] (see [[wp:mos#section management]])--&gt; {{main article|four causes}} aristotle suggested that the reason for anything coming about can be attributed to four different types of simultaneously active factors.  his name ''aitia'' is traditionally translated as "cause", but it does not always refer to temporal sequence;  it might be better translated as "explanation", but the traditional rendering will be employed here. * [[material cause]] describes the material out of which something is composed. thus the material cause of a table is wood, and the material cause of a car is rubber and steel. it is not about action. it does not mean that one domino knocks over another domino. * the [[formal cause]] is its form, i.e., the arrangement of that matter. it tells us what a thing is, that any thing is determined by the definition, form, pattern, essence, whole, synthesis or archetype. it embraces the account of causes in terms of fundamental principles or general laws, as the whole (i.e., macrostructure) is the cause of its parts, a relationship known as the whole-part causation. plainly put, the formal cause is the idea existing in the first place as exemplar in the mind of the sculptor, and in the second place as intrinsic, determining cause, embodied in the matter. formal cause could only refer to the essential quality of causation. a simple example of the formal cause is the mental image or idea that allows an artist, architect, or engineer to create a drawing. * the [[efficient cause]] is "the primary source", or that from which the change under consideration proceeds. it identifies 'what makes of what is made and what causes change of what is changed' and so suggests all sorts of agents, nonliving or living, acting as the sources of change or movement or rest. representing the current understanding of causality as the relation of cause and effect, this covers the modern definitions of "cause" as either the agent or agency or particular events or states of affairs. so, take the two dominoes, this time of equal weighting, the first is knocked over causing the second also to fall over. * the [[final cause]] (''telos'') is its purpose, or that for the sake of which a thing exists or is done, including both purposeful and instrumental actions and activities. the final cause is the purpose or function that something is supposed to serve. this covers modern ideas of motivating causes, such as volition, need, desire, ethics, or spiritual beliefs.  additionally, things can be causes of one another, causing each other reciprocally, as hard work causes fitness and vice versa, although not in the same way or function, the one is as the beginning of change, the other as the goal. (thus aristotle first suggested a reciprocal or circular causality as a relation of mutual dependence or influence of cause upon effect.) moreover, aristotle indicated that the same thing can be the cause of contrary effects; its presence and absence may result in different outcomes. simply it is the goal or purpose that brings about an event. our two dominoes require someone or something to intentionally knock over the first domino, because it cannot fall of its own accord.  aristotle marked two modes of causation: proper (prior) causation and accidental (chance) causation. all causes, both proper and incidental, can be spoken of as actual or potential, and as generic or particular. the same language refers to the effects of causes, so that actual effects are assigned to operating causes, generic effects to generic causes, and particular effects to particular causes.  ====optics==== aristotle held more accurate theories on some optical concepts than other philosophers of his day. the second oldest written evidence of a [[camera obscura]] (after [[mozi]] c. 400 bc) can be found in aristotle's documentation of such a device in 350&amp;nbsp;bc in ''problemata''. aristotle's apparatus contained a dark chamber that had a single small hole, or [[aperture]], to allow for sunlight to enter. aristotle used the device to make observations of the sun and noted that no matter what shape the hole was, the sun would still be correctly displayed as a round object. in modern cameras, this is analogous to the [[diaphragm (optics)|diaphragm]]. aristotle also made the observation that when the distance between the aperture and the surface with the image increased, the image was magnified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=lahanas |first=michael |url=http://www.mlahanas.de/greeks/optics.htm |title=optics and ancient greeks |publisher=mlahanas.de |accessdate=26 april 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411051535/http://www.mlahanas.de/greeks/optics.htm |archivedate=11 april 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ====chance and spontaneity==== according to aristotle, spontaneity and chance are causes of some things, distinguishable from other types of cause. chance as an incidental cause lies in the realm of [[sumbebekos|accidental things]]. it is "from what is spontaneous" (but note that what is spontaneous does not come from chance). for a better understanding of aristotle's conception of "chance" it might be better to think of "coincidence": something takes place by chance if a person sets out with the intent of having one thing take place, but with the result of another thing (not intended) taking place.  for example: a person seeks donations. that person may find another person willing to donate a substantial sum. however, if the person seeking the donations met the person donating, not for the purpose of collecting donations, but for some other purpose, aristotle would call the collecting of the donation by that particular donator a result of chance. it must be unusual that something happens by chance. in other words, if something happens all or most of the time, we cannot say that it is by chance.  there is also more specific kind of chance, which aristotle names "luck", that can only apply to human beings, because it is in the sphere of moral actions. according to aristotle, luck must involve choice (and thus deliberation), and only humans are capable of deliberation and choice. "what is not capable of action cannot do anything by chance".&lt;ref&gt;aristotle, ''physics'' 2.6&lt;/ref&gt;  ===metaphysics=== {{main article|metaphysics (aristotle)}}  aristotle defines metaphysics as "the knowledge of [[hylomorphism|immaterial]] being," or of "being in the highest degree of [[abstraction]]." he refers to metaphysics as "first philosophy", as well as "the theologic science".  ====substance, potentiality and actuality==== {{see also|potentiality and actuality (aristotle)}} aristotle examines the concepts of [[substance theory|substance]] and [[essence]] (''ousia'') in his ''metaphysics'' (book vii), and he concludes that a particular substance is a combination of both matter and form. in book viii, he distinguishes the matter of the substance as the [[material substratum|substratum]], or the stuff of which it is composed. for example, the matter of a house is the bricks, stones, timbers etc., or whatever constitutes the ''potential'' house, while the form of the substance is the ''actual'' house, namely 'covering for bodies and chattels' or any other [[genus-differentia definition|differentia]] (see also [[predicables]]) that let us define something as a house. the formula that gives the components is the account of the matter, and the formula that gives the differentia is the account of the form.&lt;ref&gt;aristotle, ''metaphysics'' viii 1043a 10&#x2013;30&lt;/ref&gt;  with regard to the change (''[[potentiality and actuality|kinesis]]'') and its causes now, as he defines in his ''[[physics (aristotle)|physics]]'' and ''[[on generation and corruption]]'' 319b&#x2013;320a, he distinguishes the coming to be from: # growth and diminution, which is change in quantity; # locomotion, which is change in space; and # alteration, which is change in quality.  the coming to be is a change where nothing persists of which the resultant is a property. in that particular change he introduces the concept of potentiality (''[[dunamis|dynamis]]'') and actuality (''[[entelecheia]]'') in association with the matter and the form.  referring to potentiality, this is what a thing is capable of doing, or being acted upon, if the conditions are right and it is not prevented by something else. for example, the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially (''dynamei'') plant, and if is not prevented by something, it will become a plant. potentially beings can either 'act' (''poiein'') or 'be acted upon' (''paschein''), which can be either innate or learned. for example, the eyes possess the potentiality of sight (innate&amp;nbsp;&#x2013; being acted upon), while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning (exercise&amp;nbsp;&#x2013; acting).  actuality is the fulfillment of the end of the potentiality. because the end (''telos'') is the principle of every change, and for the sake of the end exists potentiality, therefore actuality is the end. referring then to our previous example, we could say that an actuality is when a plant does one of the activities that plants do. &lt;blockquote&gt;for that for the sake of which a thing is, is its principle, and the becoming is for the sake of the end; and the actuality is the end, and it is for the sake of this that the potentiality is acquired. for animals do not see in order that they may have sight, but they have sight that they may see.&lt;ref&gt;aristotle, ''metaphysics'' ix 1050a 5&#x2013;10&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; in summary, the matter used to make a house has potentiality to be a house and both the activity of building and the form of the final house are actualities, which is also a [[final cause]] or end. then aristotle proceeds and concludes that the actuality is prior to potentiality in formula, in time and in substantiality.  with this [[definition]] of the particular substance (i.e., matter and form), aristotle tries to solve the problem of the unity of the beings, for example, "what is it that makes a man one"? since, according to plato there are two ideas: animal and biped, how then is man a unity? however, according to aristotle, the potential being (matter) and the actual one (form) are one and the same thing.&lt;ref&gt;aristotle, ''metaphysics'' viii 1045a&#x2013;b&lt;/ref&gt;  ====universals and particulars==== {{main article|aristotle's theory of universals}} aristotle's predecessor, plato, argued that all things have a universal form, which could be either a property or a relation to other things. when we look at an apple, for example, we see an apple, and we can also analyze a form of an apple. in this distinction, there is a particular apple and a universal form of an apple. moreover, we can place an apple next to a book, so that we can speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other.  plato argued that there are some universal forms that are not a part of particular things. for example, it is possible that there is no particular good in existence, but "good" is still a proper universal form. [[bertrand russell]] is a 20th-century philosopher who agreed with plato on the existence of "uninstantiated universals".  aristotle disagreed with plato on this point, arguing that all universals are instantiated. aristotle argued that there are no universals that are unattached to existing things. according to aristotle, if a universal exists, either as a particular or a relation, then there must have been, must be currently, or must be in the future, something on which the universal can be predicated. consequently, according to aristotle, if it is not the case that some universal can be predicated to an object that exists at some period of time, then it does not exist.  in addition, aristotle disagreed with plato about the location of universals. as plato spoke of the world of the forms, a location where all universal forms subsist, aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated. so, according to aristotle, the form of apple exists within each apple, rather than in the world of the forms.  ===biology and medicine=== {{main article|aristotle's biology}}  in aristotelian science, especially in biology, things he saw himself have stood the test of time better than his retelling of the reports of others, which contain error and superstition. he dissected animals but not humans; his ideas on how the human body works have been almost entirely superseded.  ====empirical research program==== [[file:octopus3.jpg|thumb|octopus swimming]] [[file:torpedo fuscomaculata2.jpg|thumb|''torpedo fuscomaculata'']] [[file:triakis semifasciata.jpg|thumb|leopard shark]]  aristotle is the earliest natural historian whose work has survived in some detail. aristotle certainly did research on the natural history of [[lesbos]], and the surrounding seas and neighbouring areas. the works that reflect this research, the ''[[history of animals]]'', ''[[generation of animals]]'', ''[[movement of animals]]'', and ''[[parts of animals]]'', contain some observations and interpretations, along with sundry myths and mistakes. the most striking passages are about the sea-life visible from observation on lesbos and available from the catches of fishermen. his observations on [[catfish]], [[electric ray|electric fish]] (''[[torpedo (genus)|torpedo]]'') and angler-fish are detailed, as is his writing on [[cephalopod]]s, namely, ''octopus'', ''sepia'' ([[cuttlefish]]) and the paper nautilus (''[[argonauta argo]]''). his description of the [[hectocotylus|hectocotyl arm]], used in sexual reproduction, was widely disbelieved until its rediscovery in the 19th century. he separated the aquatic mammals from fish, and knew that sharks and rays were part of the group he called selach&#x113; ([[selachians]]).&lt;ref name="singer, charles 1931"&gt;singer, charles. ''a short history of biology''. oxford 1931.&lt;/ref&gt;  an example of his methods, including dissection and observation, comes from the ''generation of animals'', where he describes breaking open fertilized chicken eggs at intervals to discover the sequence in which visible organs are generated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=leroi |first1=armand marie (presenter) |title=aristotle's lagoon: embryo inside a chicken's egg |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00gqlyy |publisher=bbc |accessdate=17 november 2016 |date=3 may 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=armand marie leroi |author=leroi, armand marie |title=the lagoon: how aristotle invented science |titlelink=aristotle's lagoon |publisher=viking |date=2014 |isbn=978-0670026746}}&lt;/ref&gt;

what the modern zoologist would call vertebrates and invertebrates, aristotle called 'animals with blood' and 'animals without blood'. animals with blood were divided into live-bearing (mammals), and egg-bearing (birds and fish). invertebrates ('animals without blood') are insects, crustacea (divided into non-shelled &#x2013; cephalopods &#x2013; and shelled) and testacea (molluscs).  aristotle believed that intellectual purposes, i.e., [[final cause]]s, guided all natural processes. such a [[teleological]] view gave aristotle cause to justify his observed data as an expression of formal design. noting that "no animal has, at the same time, both tusks and horns," and "a single-hooved animal with two horns i have never seen," aristotle suggested that nature, giving no animal both horns and tusks, was staving off vanity, and giving creatures faculties only to such a degree as they are necessary. noting that ruminants had multiple stomachs and weak teeth, he supposed the first was to compensate for the latter, with nature trying to preserve a type of balance.&lt;ref&gt;mason, ''a history of the sciences'' pp. 43&#x2013;44&lt;/ref&gt;  he stated in the ''history of animals'' that creatures were arranged in a graded scale of perfection rising from minerals to plants and animals, and on up to man, forming the ''[[great chain of being|scala naturae]]'' or great chain of being.&lt;ref&gt;mayr, ''the growth of biological thought'', pp. 201&#x2013;02; see also: lovejoy, ''the great chain of being''&lt;/ref&gt; his system had eleven grades, arranged according "to the degree to which they are infected with potentiality", expressed in their form at birth. the highest animals laid warm and wet creatures alive, the lowest bore theirs cold, dry, and in thick eggs. for [[charles singer]], "nothing is more remarkable than [aristotle's] efforts to [exhibit] the relationships of living things as a ''scala naturae''".&lt;ref name="singer, charles 1931"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;aristotle, of course, is not responsible for the later use made of this idea by clerics.&lt;/ref&gt;  aristotle also held that the level of a creature's perfection was reflected in its form, but not preordained by that form. ideas like this, and his ideas about souls, are not regarded as science at all in modern times.  he placed emphasis on the type(s) of soul an organism possessed, asserting that plants possess a vegetative soul, responsible for reproduction and growth, animals a vegetative and a sensitive soul, responsible for mobility and sensation, and humans a vegetative, a sensitive, and a rational soul, capable of thought and reflection.&lt;ref&gt;aristotle, ''de anima'' ii 3&lt;/ref&gt;  aristotle, in contrast to earlier philosophers, but in accordance with the egyptians, placed the rational soul in the heart, rather than the brain.&lt;ref&gt;mason, ''a history of the sciences'' pp. 45&lt;/ref&gt; notable is aristotle's division of sensation and thought, which generally went against previous philosophers, with the exception of [[alcmaeon of croton|alcmaeon]].&lt;ref&gt;guthrie, ''a history of greek philosophy'' vol. 1 p. 348&lt;/ref&gt;  ====successor: theophrastus==== {{main article|theophrastus|historia plantarum (theophrastus)}} [[file:161theophrastus 161 frontespizio.jpg|thumb|220px|the [[book frontispiece|frontispiece]] to a 1644 version of the expanded and illustrated edition of ''[[historia plantarum (theophrastus)|historia plantarum]]'' (ca. 1200), which was originally written around 300 bc.]]  aristotle's successor at the [[lyceum (classical)|lyceum]], [[theophrastus]], wrote a series of books on botany &#x2013; the ''history of plants'' &#x2013; which survived as the most important contribution of antiquity to botany, even into the [[middle ages]]. many of theophrastus' names survive into modern times, such as ''carpos'' for fruit, and ''pericarpion'' for seed vessel.  rather than focus on formal causes, as aristotle did, theophrastus suggested a mechanistic scheme, drawing analogies between natural and artificial processes, and relying on aristotle's concept of the [[efficient cause]]. theophrastus also recognized the role of sex in the reproduction of some higher plants, though this last discovery was lost in later ages.&lt;ref&gt;mayr, ''the growth of biological thought'', pp. 90&#x2013;91; mason, ''a history of the sciences'', p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;  ====influence on hellenistic medicine==== {{details|medicine in ancient greece}} after theophrastus, the lyceum failed to produce any original work. though interest in aristotle's ideas survived, they were generally taken unquestioningly.&lt;ref name="annas 2001, p. 252"&gt;annas, "classical greek philosophy", 2001, p. 252&lt;/ref&gt; it is not until the age of [[alexandria]] under the [[ptolemaic dynasty|ptolemies]] that advances in biology can be again found.  the first medical teacher at alexandria, [[herophilos|herophilus of chalcedon]], corrected aristotle, placing intelligence in the brain, and connected the nervous system to motion and sensation. herophilus also distinguished between [[vein]]s and [[artery|arteries]], noting that the latter [[pulse]] while the former do not.&lt;ref&gt;mason, ''a history of the sciences'' p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; though a few ancient [[atomism|atomists]] such as [[lucretius]] challenged the [[teleology|teleological]] viewpoint of aristotelian ideas about life, teleology (and after the rise of christianity, [[natural theology]]) would remain central to biological thought essentially until the 18th and 19th centuries. [[ernst mayr]] claimed that there was "nothing of any real consequence in biology after lucretius and galen until the renaissance."&lt;ref&gt;mayr, ''the growth of biological thought'', pp. 90&#x2013;94; quotation from p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; aristotle's ideas of natural history and medicine survived, but they were generally taken unquestioningly.&lt;ref name="annas 2001, p. 252"/&gt;  ===psychology=== aristotle's [[psychology]], given in his treatise ''[[on the soul]]'' (''peri psyche'', often known by its [[latin]] title ''de anima''), posits three kinds of [[soul]] ("psyches"): the vegetative soul, the sensitive soul, and the rational soul. humans have a rational soul. this kind of soul is capable of the same powers as the other kinds: like the vegetative soul it can grow and nourish itself; like the sensitive soul it can experience sensations and move locally. the unique part of the human, rational soul is its ability to receive forms of other things and compare them.  for aristotle, the soul (''psyche'') was a simpler concept than it is for us today. by soul he simply meant the [[hylomorphism#body&#x2013;soul hylomorphism|form]] of a living being. because all beings are composites of form and matter, the form of living beings is that which endows them with what is specific to living beings, e.g. the ability to initiate movement (or in the case of plants, growth and chemical transformations, which aristotle considers types of movement).&lt;ref&gt;stanford encyclopedia of philosophy, article [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-psychology/ "psychology"].&lt;/ref&gt;  ====memory====  according to aristotle, [[memory]] is the ability to hold a perceived experience in your mind and to have the ability to distinguish between the internal "appearance" and an occurrence in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=bloch |first=david |url=https://books.google.com/?id=qwthng_5rqac&amp;pg=pr9&amp;dq=aristotle+on+memory+and+recollection#v=onepage&amp;q=aristotle%20on%20memory%20and%20recollection&amp;f=false |title=aristotle on memory and recollection |date=2007 |page=12|isbn=90-04-16046-9 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; in other words, a memory is a mental picture ([[wikt:phantasm|phantasm]]) in which aristotle defines in ''de anima'', as an appearance which is imprinted on the part of the body that forms a memory. aristotle believed an "imprint" becomes impressed on a semi-fluid bodily organ that undergoes several changes in order to make a memory. a memory occurs when a [[stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]] is too complex that the nervous system (semi-fluid bodily organ) cannot receive all the impressions at once. these changes are the same as those involved in the operations of [[sense|sensation]], [[common sense]], and [[thinking]] .{{sfn|bloch|2007|p=61}} the mental picture imprinted on the bodily organ is the final product of the entire process of sense perception. it does not matter if the experience was seen or heard, every experience ends up as a mental image in memory &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=carruthers |first=mary |url=https://books.google.com/?id=dntranqfiasc&amp;pg=pr8&amp;dq=the+book+of+memory:+the+study+of+memory+in+medieval+times#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20book%20of%20memory%3a%20the%20study%20of%20memory%20in%20medieval%20times&amp;f=false |title=the book of memory: a study of memory in medieval culture |date=2007 |page=16|isbn=978-0-521-42973-3 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  aristotle uses the word "memory" for two basic abilities. first, the actual retaining of the experience in the [[mnemonic]] "imprint" that can develop from sensation. second, the intellectual anxiety that comes with the "imprint" due to being impressed at a particular time and processing specific contents. these abilities can be explained as memory is neither sensation nor thinking because is arises only after a lapse of time. therefore, memory is of the past, {{sfn|bloch|2007|p=25}} prediction is of the future, and sensation is of the present. the retrieval of our "imprints" cannot be performed suddenly. a transitional channel is needed and located in our past experiences, both for our previous experience and present experience.  aristotle proposed that slow-witted people have good memory because the fluids in their brain do not wash away their memory organ used to imprint experiences and so the "imprint" can easily continue. however, they cannot be too slow or the hardened surface of the organ will not receive new "imprints". he believed the young and the old do not properly develop an "imprint". young people undergo rapid changes as they develop, while the elderly's organs are beginning to decay, thus stunting new "imprints". likewise, people who are too quick-witted are similar to the young and the image cannot be fixed because of the rapid changes of their organ. because intellectual functions are not involved in memory, memories belong to some animals too, but only those in which have [[perception]] of time.  =====recollection===== because aristotle believes people receive all kinds of sense perceptions and people perceive them as images or "imprints", people are continually weaving together new "imprints" of things they experience. in order to search for these "imprints", people search the memory itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=warren |first=howard |url=https://books.google.com/?id=d4ixaaaayaaj&amp;pg=pa3&amp;dq=the+history+of+the+association+of+psychology#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20history%20of%20the%20association%20of%20psychology&amp;f=false |title=a history of the association psychology |date=1921 |page=30 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; within the memory, if one [[experience]] is offered instead of a specific memory, that person will reject this experience until they find what they are looking for. [[recall (memory)|recollection]] occurs when one experience naturally follows another. if the chain of "images" is needed, one memory will stimulate the other. if the chain of "images" is not needed, but expected, then it will only stimulate the other memory in most instances. when people recall experiences, they stimulate certain previous experiences until they have stimulated the one that was needed.{{sfn|warren|1921|p=25}}  recollection is the self-directed activity of retrieving the information stored in a memory "imprint" after some time has passed. retrieval of stored information is dependent on the scope of mnemonic capabilities of a being (human or animal) and the abilities the human or animal possesses.{{sfn|carruthers|2007|p=19}} only humans will remember "imprints" of intellectual activity, such as numbers and words. animals that have perception of time will be able to retrieve memories of their past observations. remembering involves only perception of the things remembered and of the time passed. recollection of an "imprint" is when the present experiences a person remembers are similar with elements corresponding in character and arrangement of past sensory experiences. when an "imprint" is recalled, it may bring forth a large group of related "imprints".{{sfn|warren|1921|p=296}}  aristotle believed the chain of thought, which ends in recollection of certain "imprints", was connected systematically in three sorts of relationships: similarity, contrast, and contiguity. these three laws make up his [[laws of association]]. aristotle believed that past experiences are hidden within our mind. a force operates to awaken the hidden material to bring up the actual experience. according to aristotle, association is the power innate in a mental state, which operates upon the unexpressed remains of former experiences, allowing them to rise and be recalled.{{sfn|warren|1921|p=259}}  ====dreams====  =====sleep===== before understanding aristotle's views on dreams, first his idea of sleep must be examined. aristotle gives an account of his explanation of sleep in ''on sleep and wakefulness''.&lt;ref name="aristotle on dreaming: what goes on in sleep when the 'big fire' goes out"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=holowchak|first1=mark|title=aristotle on dreaming: what goes on in sleep when the 'big fire' goes out|journal=ancient philosophy|date=1996|volume=16|issue=2|pages=405&#x2013;23|url=http://www.pdcnet.org/ancientphil/ancient-philosophy|accessdate=7 november 2014|doi=10.5840/ancientphil199616244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

in dreams, sensation is still involved, but in an altered manner than when awake.&lt;ref name="ref 2"/&gt; aristotle explains the phenomenon that occurs when a person stares at a moving stimulus such as the waves in a body of water.&lt;ref name="aristotle on dreaming: what goes on in sleep when the 'big fire' goes out"/&gt; when they look away from that stimulus, the next thing they look at appears to be moving in a wave like motion. when a person perceives a stimulus and the stimulus is no longer the focus of their attention, it leaves an impression.&lt;ref name="aristotle on dreaming: what goes on in sleep when the 'big fire' goes out"/&gt; when the body is awake and the senses are functioning properly, a person constantly encounters new stimuli to sense and so the impressions left from previously perceived stimuli become irrelevant.&lt;ref name="ref 2"/&gt;

 ===practical philosophy===  ====ethics==== {{main article|aristotelian ethics}} aristotle considered ethics to be a practical rather than theoretical study, i.e., one aimed at becoming good and doing good rather than knowing for its own sake. he wrote several treatises on ethics, including most notably, the ''[[nicomachean ethics]]''.  aristotle taught that virtue has to do with the proper function (''ergon'') of a thing. an eye is only a good eye in so much as it can see, because the proper function of an eye is sight. aristotle reasoned that humans must have a function specific to humans, and that this function must be an activity of the ''[[de anima|psuch&#x113;]]'' (normally translated as ''soul'') in accordance with reason (''[[logos]]''). aristotle identified such an optimum activity of the soul as the aim of all human deliberate action, ''[[eudaimonia]]'', generally translated as "happiness" or sometimes "well being". to have the potential of ever being happy in this way necessarily requires a good character (''&#x113;thik&#x113;'' ''[[arete (moral virtue)|aret&#x113;]]''), often translated as moral (or ethical) virtue (or excellence).&lt;ref&gt;[[nicomachean ethics]] book i. see for example chapter 7 [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=perseus%3atext%3a1999.01.0054%3abekker%20page%3d1098a 1098a].&lt;/ref&gt;  aristotle taught that to achieve a virtuous and potentially happy character requires a first stage of having the fortune to be habituated not deliberately, but by teachers, and experience, leading to a later stage in which one consciously chooses to do the best things. when the best people come to live life this way their practical wisdom (''[[phronesis]]'') and their intellect (''[[nous]]'') can develop with each other towards the highest possible human virtue, the wisdom of an accomplished [[theory|theoretical]] or speculative thinker, or in other words, a philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;[[nicomachean ethics]] book vi.&lt;/ref&gt;  ====politics==== {{main article|politics (aristotle)}} [[file:aristotle-constitutions-2.png|thumb|240px|aristotle's classification of [[constitution]]s]]  in addition to his works on ethics, which address the individual, aristotle addressed the city in his work titled ''[[politics (aristotle)|politics]]''. aristotle considered the city to be a natural community. moreover, he considered the city to be prior in importance to the family which in turn is prior to the individual, "for the whole must of necessity be prior to the part".&lt;ref&gt;politics 1253a19&#x2013;24&lt;/ref&gt; he also famously stated that "man is by nature a political animal" and also arguing that humanity's defining factor among others in the [[animal|animal kingdom]] is its [[rationality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=aristotle |others=translated by ernest barker and revised with introduction and notes by r. f. stalley |title=politics |date=2009 |publisher=oxford university press |location=oxford |isbn=978-0-19-953873-7 |pages=320&#x2013;21 |edition=1st ed. 1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; aristotle conceived of politics as being like an [[organism]] rather than like a machine, and as a collection of parts none of which can exist without the others. aristotle's conception of the city is organic, and he is considered one of the first to conceive of the city in this manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=ebenstein |first=alan |author-link=alan o. ebenstein |author2=william ebenstein |title=introduction to political thinkers |publisher=wadsworth group |date=2002 |page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the common modern understanding of a political community as a modern state is quite different from aristotle's understanding. although he was aware of the existence and potential of larger empires, the natural community according to aristotle was the city (''[[polis]]'') which functions as a political "community" or "partnership" (''koin&#x14d;nia'')&lt;!-- (1252a1) --&gt;. the aim of the city is not just to avoid injustice or for economic stability&lt;!-- (1280b29&#x2013;31) --&gt;, but rather to allow at least some citizens the possibility to live a good life, and to perform beautiful acts: "the political partnership must be regarded, therefore, as being for the sake of noble actions, not for the sake of living together&lt;!-- (1281a1&#x2013;3) --&gt;." this is distinguished from modern approaches, beginning with [[social contract]] theory, according to which individuals leave the [[state of nature]] because of "fear of violent death" or its "inconveniences."&lt;ref&gt;for a different reading of social and economic processes in the ''nicomachean ethics'' and ''politics'' see polanyi, k.

for all that this man will choose, if the choice is based on his knowledge, are good things and their contraries are bad. and since everybody chooses most of all what conforms to their own proper dispositions (a just man choosing to live justly, a man with bravery to live bravely, likewise a self-controlled man to live with self-control), it is clear that the intelligent man will choose most of all to be intelligent; for this is the function of that capacity. hence it's evident that, according to the most authoritative judgment, intelligence is supreme among goods.''  ====rhetoric and poetics==== {{main article|rhetoric (aristotle)|poetics (aristotle)}} aristotle considered [[epic poetry]], tragedy, comedy, [[dithyramb|dithyrambic poetry]] and music to be [[mimesis|imitative]], each varying in imitation by medium, object, and manner.&lt;ref&gt;aristotle, ''poetics'' i 1447a&lt;/ref&gt; for example, music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony, whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone, and poetry with language. the forms also differ in their object of imitation. comedy, for instance, is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average. lastly, the forms differ in their manner of imitation &#x2013; through narrative or character, through change or no change, and through drama or no drama.&lt;ref&gt;aristotle, ''poetics'' iii&lt;/ref&gt; aristotle believed that imitation is natural to mankind and constitutes one of mankind's advantages over animals.&lt;ref&gt;aristotle, ''poetics'' iv&lt;/ref&gt;  while it is believed that aristotle's ''poetics'' comprised two books &#x2013; one on comedy and one on tragedy &#x2013; only the portion that focuses on tragedy has survived. aristotle taught that tragedy is composed of six elements: plot-structure, character, style, thought, spectacle, and lyric poetry.&lt;ref&gt;aristotle, ''poetics'' vi&lt;/ref&gt; the characters in a tragedy are merely a means of driving the story; and the plot, not the characters, is the chief focus of tragedy. tragedy is the imitation of action arousing pity and fear, and is meant to effect the [[catharsis]] of those same emotions. aristotle concludes ''poetics'' with a discussion on which, if either, is superior: epic or tragic [[mimesis]]. he suggests that because tragedy possesses all the attributes of an epic, possibly possesses additional attributes such as spectacle and music, is more unified, and achieves the aim of its mimesis in shorter scope, it can be considered superior to epic.&lt;ref&gt;aristotle, ''poetics'' xxvi&lt;/ref&gt;  aristotle was a keen systematic collector of riddles, folklore, and proverbs; he and his school had a special interest in the riddles of the [[pythia|delphic oracle]] and studied the fables of [[aesop]].&lt;ref&gt;temple, olivia, and temple, robert (translators), [https://books.google.com/books?id=zb-rvxpvtpec&amp;pg=pr3&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=0_0 the complete fables by aesop] penguin classics, 1998. {{isbn|0-14-044649-4}} cf. introduction, pp. xi&#x2013;xii.&lt;/ref&gt;  ===views on women=== {{main article|aristotle's views on women}} aristotle's analysis of procreation describes an active, ensouling masculine element bringing life to an inert, passive female element. on this ground, [[feminist metaphysics]] have accused aristotle of [[misogyny]]&lt;ref name="freeland"&gt;{{cite book |last=freeland |first=cynthia a. | title=feminist interpretations of aristotle | publisher=penn state university press | date=1998 | isbn=0-271-01730-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[sexism]].&lt;ref name="morsink"&gt;{{cite journal |last=morsink |first=johannes | jstor=10.2307/4330727 | title=was aristotle's biology sexist?

modern scholars commonly assume these latter to be aristotle's own (unpolished) lecture notes (or in some cases possible notes by his students).{{sfn|barnes|1995|p=12}} however, one classic scholar offers an alternative interpretation. the 5th century [[neoplatonist]] [[ammonius hermiae]] writes that aristotle's writing style is deliberately [[obscurantism|obscurantist]] so that "good people may for that reason stretch their mind even more, whereas empty minds that are lost through carelessness will be put to flight by the obscurity when they encounter sentences like these."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=ammonius | date= 1991 | title= on aristotle's categories | location= ithaca, ny | publisher= cornell university press | isbn= 0-8014-2688-x |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  another common assumption is that none of the exoteric works is extant &#x2013; that all of aristotle's extant writings are of the esoteric kind. current knowledge of what exactly the exoteric writings were like is scant and dubious, though many of them may have been in dialogue form. (''fragments'' of some of aristotle's dialogues have survived.) perhaps it is to these that [[cicero]] refers when he characterized aristotle's writing style as "a river of gold";{{sfn|cicero|1874|loc=&#xa7;

''aristotle transformed'' london, 1990, pp. 20, 28, 35&#x2013;36.&lt;/ref&gt; [[john philoponus]] stands out for having attempted a fundamental critique of aristotle's views on the eternity of the world, movement, and other elements of aristotelian thought.&lt;ref&gt;richard sorabji, ed. ''aristotle transformed'' (london, 1990) pp. 233&#x2013;74.&lt;/ref&gt; after a hiatus of several centuries, formal commentary by eustratius and [[michael of ephesus]] reappears in the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries, apparently sponsored by [[anna comnena]].&lt;ref&gt;richard sorabji, ed. ''aristotle transformed'' (london, 1990) pp. 20&#x2013;21; 28&#x2013;29, 393&#x2013;406; 407&#x2013;08.&lt;/ref&gt;  ===influence on islamic theologians=== aristotle was one of the most revered western thinkers in early [[islamic theology]]. most of the still extant works of aristotle,&lt;ref name="referencea"&gt;''encyclopedia of islam'', ''aristutalis''&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a number of the original greek commentaries, were translated into arabic and studied by [[muslim]] philosophers, scientists and scholars. [[averroes]], [[avicenna]] and [[alpharabius]], who wrote on aristotle in great depth, also influenced [[thomas aquinas]] and other western christian scholastic philosophers. [[alkindus]] considered aristotle as the outstanding and unique representative of philosophy&lt;ref&gt;''rasa'il'' i, 103, 17, abu rida&lt;/ref&gt; and averroes spoke of aristotle as the "exemplar" for all future philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;''comm. magnum'' in aristotle'', ''de anima'', iii, 2, 43 crawford&lt;/ref&gt; medieval muslim scholars regularly described aristotle as the "first teacher".&lt;ref&gt;''al-mua'llim al-thani'', ''aristutalis''&lt;/ref&gt; the title "teacher" was first given to aristotle by muslim scholars, and was later used by western philosophers (as in the famous poem of [[dante alighieri|dante]]) who were influenced by the tradition of [[islamic philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=nasr |first=seyyed hossein |title=the islamic intellectual tradition in persia |date=1996 |publisher=curzon press|isbn=0-7007-0314-4 |pages=59&#x2013;60}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in accordance with the [[greeks|greek]] theorists, the muslims considered aristotle to be a dogmatic philosopher, the author of a closed system, and believed that aristotle shared with [[plato]] essential tenets of thought. some went so far as to credit aristotle himself with neo-platonic metaphysical ideas.&lt;ref name="referencea"/&gt;  ===influence on western christian theologians=== with the loss of the study of ancient greek in the early medieval latin west, aristotle was practically unknown there from c. ad 600 to c. 1100 except through the latin translation of the ''organon'' made by [[boethius]]. in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, interest in aristotle revived and latin christians had translations made, both from arabic translations, such as those by [[gerard of cremona]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite sep |url-id=arabic-islamic-influence |title=influence of arabic and islamic philosophy on the latin west}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from the original greek, such as those by [[james of venice]] and [[william of moerbeke]].  after [[thomas aquinas]] wrote his theology, working from moerbeke's translations, the demand for aristotle's writings grew and the [[greek language|greek]] manuscripts returned to the west, stimulating a revival of aristotelianism in europe that continued into the [[renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite sep |url-id=aristotelianism-renaissance |title=aristotelianism in the renaissance}}&lt;/ref&gt; aristotle is referred to as "the philosopher" by [[scholasticism|scholastic]] thinkers such as [[thomas aquinas]] (see ''[[summa theologica]]'', part i, question 3, etc.). these thinkers blended aristotelian philosophy with christianity, bringing the thought of ancient greece into the middle ages. it required a repudiation of some aristotelian principles for the sciences and the arts to free themselves for the discovery of modern scientific laws and empirical methods. the medieval english poet [[geoffrey chaucer|chaucer]] describes his student as being happy by having  &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;at his beddes heed twenty bookes, clad in blak or reed, of aristotle and his philosophie,&lt;ref&gt;geoffrey chaucer, ''[[the canterbury tales]]'', prologue, lines 295&#x2013;295&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  the italian poet [[dante alighieri|dante]] says of aristotle in [[the divine comedy|the first circles of hell]],  &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;vidi 'l maestro di color che sanno seder tra filosofica famiglia. tutti lo miran, tutti onor li fanno: quivi vid'&#xef;o socrate e platone che 'nnanzi a li altri pi&#xf9; presso li stanno;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;i saw the master there of those who know, amid the philosophic family, by all admired, and by all reverenced; there plato too i saw, and socrates, who stood beside him closer than the rest. :&#x2014;dante, ''l'inferno'' (hell), canto iv. lines 131&#x2013;135&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  ===post-enlightenment thinkers=== the german philosopher [[friedrich nietzsche]] has been said to have taken nearly all of his political philosophy from aristotle.&lt;ref&gt;durant, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; however debatable this is, aristotle rigidly separated action from production, and argued for the deserved subservience of some people ("natural [[slavery|slaves]]"), and the natural superiority (virtue, ''arete'') of others. it is [[martin heidegger]], not nietzsche, who elaborated a new interpretation of aristotle, intended to warrant his deconstruction of scholastic and philosophical tradition. [[ayn rand]] accredited aristotle as "the greatest philosopher in history" and cited him as a major influence on her thinking. more recently, [[alasdair macintyre]] has attempted to reform what he calls the aristotelian tradition in a way that is anti-elitist and capable of disputing the claims of both liberals and nietzscheans.&lt;ref&gt;kelvin knight, ''aristotelian philosophy'', polity press, 2007, ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;  ==list of works== {{main article|corpus aristotelicum}}  the works of aristotle that have survived from antiquity through medieval manuscript transmission are collected in the corpus aristotelicum. these texts, as opposed to aristotle's lost works, are technical philosophical treatises from within aristotle's school. reference to them is made according to the organization of [[immanuel bekker]]'s royal prussian academy edition (''aristotelis opera edidit academia regia borussica'', berlin, 1831&#x2013;1870), which in turn is based on ancient classifications of these works.  ==eponyms== [[file:aristotle - jefferson building - library of congress.jpg|thumb|250px|"aristotle" near the ceiling of the great hall in the [[library of congress]]]] the [[aristotle mountains]] along the [[oscar ii coast]] of [[graham land]], [[antarctica]], are named after aristotle. he was the first person known to conjecture, in his book ''[[meteorology (aristotle)|meteorology]]'', the existence of a landmass in the southern high-latitude region and call it "antarctica".&lt;ref&gt;[https://data.aad.gov.au/aadc/gaz/scar/display_name.cfm?gaz_id=137410 aristotle mountains.] [[scar]] [[composite antarctic gazetteer]].&lt;/ref&gt;  [[aristoteles (crater)|aristoteles]] is a crater on the moon bearing the classical form of aristotle's name.  ==see also== * [[aristotelian physics]] * [[aristotelian society]] * [[aristotelian theology]] * [[conimbricenses]] * [[list of writers influenced by aristotle]] * [[otium]] * [[philia]] * [[pseudo-aristotle]]  ==notes and references== {{reflist}}  ==further reading== the secondary literature on aristotle is vast. the following references are only a small selection. {{refbegin|30em}} * [[j. l. ackrill|ackrill j. l.]] (1997).

 gershwin collaborated on the original program notes with the critic and composer [[deems taylor]], noting that: "my purpose here is to portray the impression of an american visitor in paris as he strolls about the city and listens to various street noises and absorbs the french atmosphere." when the tone poem moves into the [[blues]], "our american friend ... has succumbed to a spasm of [[homesickness]]." but, "nostalgia is not a fatal disease." the american visitor "once again is an alert spectator of parisian life" and "the street noises and french atmosphere are triumphant."  ==background== gershwin was attracted by [[maurice ravel]]'s unusual chords.  after transatlantic letters back and forth as to whether ravel took students and how much he charged, ravel looked at gershwin's prior year earnings and sent a telegram to gershwin jokingly saying he (ravel) should study with gershwin. but ravel accepted him as a student, and gershwin went on his first trip to paris in 1926 ready to study. after his initial student audition with ravel turned into a sharing of musical theories, ravel said he couldn't teach him but he would send a letter referring him to [[nadia boulanger]]. while the studies were cut short, that 1926 trip resulted in the initial version of an american in paris written as a 'thank you note' to  gershwin's hosts, robert and mabel shirmer. gershwin called it "a rhapsodic ballet"; it is written freely and in a much more modern idiom than his prior works.  gershwin strongly encouraged ravel to come to the united states for a tour, something ravel had been reluctant to do.  to this end, upon his return to new york, gershwin joined the efforts of ravel's friend [[e. robert schmitz|robert schmitz]], a pianist ravel had met during the war, to urge ravel to tour the u.s. schmitz was the head of pro musica, promoting franco-american musical relations, and was able to offer ravel a $12,000 fee for the tour, an enticement gershwin knew would be important to ravel.      gershwin greeted ravel in new york in february 1928 at the start of ravel's u.s. tour, and joined  ravel again later in the tour in los angeles.  after a lunch together with [[charlie chaplin|chaplin]] in beverly hills, ravel was persuaded to perform an unscheduled 'house concert' in a friend's music salon, performing among kindred spirits.  ravel's tour reignited gershwin's desire to return to paris which he did in march 1928. ravel's high praise of gershwin in an introductory letter to boulanger caused gershwin to seriously consider taking much more time to study abroad in paris.  yet after playing for her, she told him she could not teach him. nadia boulanger gave gershwin basically the same advice she gave all of her accomplished master students "don't copy others; be yourself." in this case "why try to be a second rate ravel when you are already a first rate gershwin?"  this did not set gershwin back, as his real intent abroad was to complete a new work based on paris and perhaps a second rhapsody for piano and orchestra to follow his ''[[rhapsody in blue]]''. paris at this time hosted many expatriate writers: among them [[ezra pound]], [[w. b. yeats]], [[ernest hemingway]]; and artist [[pablo picasso]].&lt;ref&gt;lsri archives oral interview anita loos and mary anita loos october 1979 re: letters and ravel's telegram to gershwin&lt;/ref&gt;  ==composition== gershwin based ''an american in paris'' on a melodic fragment called "very parisienne", written in 1926 on his first visit to paris as a gift to his hosts, robert and mabel schirmer. he described the piece as a "rhapsodic ballet" because it was written freely and is more modern than his previous works. gershwin explained in ''[[musical america]]'', "my purpose here is to portray the impressions of an american visitor in paris as he strolls about the city, listens to the various street noises, and absorbs the french atmosphere."  the piece is structured into five sections, which culminate in a loose [[ternary form|aba format]]. gershwin's first a episode introduces the two main "walking" themes in the "allegretto grazioso" and develops a third theme in the "subito con brio". the style of this a section is written in the typical french style of composers [[claude debussy]] and [[les six]]. this a section featured duple meter, singsong rhythms, and diatonic melodies with the sounds of oboe, english horn, and taxi horns. the b section's "andante ma con ritmo deciso" introduces the american [[blues]] and spasms of homesickness. the "allegro" that follows continues to express homesickness in a faster [[twelve-bar blues]]. in the b section, gershwin uses common time, syncopated rhythms, and bluesy melodies with the sounds of trumpet, saxophone, and snare drum. "moderato con grazia" is the last a section that returns to the themes set in a. after recapitulating the "walking" themes, gershwin overlays the slow blues theme from section b in the final &#x201c;grandioso.&#x201d;  ==instrumentation== ''an american in paris'' is scored for 3 [[flute]]s (3rd doubling on [[piccolo]]), 2 [[oboe]]s, [[english horn]], 2 [[clarinet]]s in [[soprano clarinet|b-flat]], [[bass clarinet]] in b-flat, 2 [[bassoon]]s, 4 [[french horn|horn]]s in f, 3 [[trumpet]]s in b-flat, 3 [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], [[snare drum]], [[bass drum]], [[triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]], [[wood block]], [[cymbal]]s, low and high [[tom-tom drum|tom-tom]]s, [[xylophone]], [[glockenspiel]], [[celesta]], 4 [[vehicle horn|taxi horns]] labeled as a, b, c and d with circles around them, [[alto saxophone]]/[[soprano saxophone]], [[tenor saxophone]]/soprano saxophone/alto saxophone, [[baritone saxophone]]/soprano saxophone/alto saxophone, and [[string section|strings]]. although most modern audiences have heard the taxi horns using the notes a, b, c and d, it has recently come to light&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/02/theater/have-we-been-playing-gershwin-wrong-for-70-years.html|title=have we been playing gershwin wrong for 70 years?|newspaper=[[the new york times]]|accessdate=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

gibbons' restored orchestration of an american in paris was performed at london's queen elizabeth hall on july 9, 2000 by the city of oxford orchestra conducted by levon parikian&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.jackgibbons.com/reviews.htm|title=musical opinion review of gershwin spectacular|accessdate=2017-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[william merrigan daly|william daly]] arranged the score for piano solo which was published by new world music in 1929.  ==response== gershwin did not particularly like walter damrosch's interpretation at the world premiere of ''an american in paris''. he stated that damrosch's sluggish, dragging tempo caused him to walk out of the hall during a matinee performance of this work. the audience, according to edward cushing, responded with "a demonstration of enthusiasm impressively genuine in contrast to the conventional applause which new music, good and bad, ordinarily arouses." critics believed that ''an american in paris'' was better crafted than his lukewarm [[concerto in f (gershwin)|concerto in f]]. some did not think it belonged in a program with classical composers [[c&#xe9;sar franck]], [[richard wagner]], or [[guillaume lekeu]] on its premiere. gershwin responded to the critics, "it's not a beethoven symphony, you know... it's a humorous piece, nothing solemn about it. it's not intended to draw tears. if it pleases symphony audiences as a light, jolly piece, a series of impressions musically expressed, it succeeds."  ==preservation status==  on september 22, 2013, it was announced that a musicological [[historical editions (music)|critical edition]] of the full orchestral score will be eventually released. the gershwin family, working in conjunction with the [[library of congress]] and the [[university of michigan]], are working to make scores available to the public that represent gershwin's true intent. it is unknown if the critical score will include the four minutes of material gershwin later deleted from the work (such as the restatement of the blues theme after the faster 12 bar blues section), or if the score will document changes in the orchestration during gershwin's composition process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/new-critical-edition-of-george-and-ira-gershwins-works-to-be-compiled/ |title=new, critical edition of george and ira gershwin's works to be compiled &amp;#124;

 two [[urtext edition]]s of the work have been published by the german publisher b-note music in 2015. the changes made by campbell-watson have been withdrawn in both editions. in the extended urtext, 120 bars of music have been re-integrated. conductor walter damrosch had cut them shortly before the first performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=an american in paris urtext | url=https://www.bnote.de/?set=werk_detail&amp;kompid=246&amp;bnnr=16963&amp;lc=en|website=bnote.de |access-date=2015-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ==recordings== [[file:american in paris.tif|thumb|first recording]] ''an american in paris'' has been frequently recorded. the first recording was made for [[rca victor]] in 1929 with [[nathaniel shilkret]] conducting the [[rca victor symphony orchestra]], drawn from members of the [[philadelphia orchestra]]. gershwin was on hand to "supervise" the recording; however, shilkret was reported to be in charge and eventually asked the composer to leave the recording studio. then, a little later, shilkret discovered there was no one to play the brief [[celesta]] solo during the slow section, so he hastily asked gershwin if he might play the solo; gershwin said he could and so he briefly participated in the actual recording. this recording is believed to use the taxi horns in the way that gershwin had intended using the notes a flat, b flat, a higher c and a lower d.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;  the radio broadcast of the september&amp;nbsp;8, 1937 hollywood bowl george gershwin memorial concert, in which ''an american in paris,'' also conducted by shilkret, was second on the program, was recorded and was released in 1998 in a two-cd set. [[arthur fiedler]] and the [[boston pops orchestra]] recorded the work for rca victor, including one of the first stereo recordings of the music. in 1945, [[arturo toscanini]] conducting  the [[nbc symphony orchestra]] recorded the piece for [[rca victor]], one of the few commercial recordings toscanini made of music by an american composer. the [[seattle symphony]] also recorded a version in 1990 of gershwin's original score, before he made numerous edits resulting in the score as we hear it today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=bargreen |first=melinda |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19900628&amp;slug=1079541 |title=entertainment &amp; the arts &amp;#124; recordings &amp;#124; seattle times newspaper |website=community.seattletimes.nwsource.com |date=1990-06-28 |accessdate=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[harry james]] released a version of the blues section on his 1953 album ''one night stand,'' recorded live at the [[aragon ballroom (chicago)|aragon ballroom in chicago]] ([[columbia records|columbia]] gl 522 and cl 522). conductor steven richman and harmonie ensemble, new york released a recording of gershwin's original orchestrations in 2016 on harmonia mundi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harmonieensembleny.com/ new cd release: gershwin cd: american in paris, concerto in f, three preludes (arr. roy bargy), overture to "of thee i sing" (1934 radio version). released august 26, 2016. harmonie ensemble/new york; steven richman, conductor, at harmonieensembleny.com] accessed 2017-06-20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://piasclassicsusa.com/harmonieensemblenewyork/ steven richman, harmonie ensemble/new york; george gershwin cd: american in paris, concerto in f, etc. release date: august 26, 2016 at piasclassicsusa.com]  accessed 2017-06-20&lt;/ref&gt;  ==use in film== in 1951, [[metro-goldwyn-mayer]] released the musical film ''[[an american in paris (film)|an american in paris]]'', featuring [[gene kelly]] and [[leslie caron]]. winning the 1951 best picture oscar and numerous other awards, the film was directed by [[vincente minnelli]], featured many tunes of gershwin, and concluded with an extensive, elaborate dance sequence built around the ''an american in paris'' symphonic poem (arranged for the film by [[johnny green]]), costing $500,000.  ==references== {{reflist}}  ==further reading== * rimler, walter.

the cost of guest tickets for that night's ceremony was $5 (${{inflation|us|5|1929}} in {{inflation-year|us}} dollars). fifteen statuettes were awarded, honoring artists, directors and other participants in the film-making industry of the time, for their works during the 1927&#x2013;28 period. the ceremony ran for 15&amp;nbsp;minutes.  winners were announced to media three months earlier. that was changed for the second ceremony in 1930. since then, for the rest of the first decade, the results were given to newspapers for publication at 11:00&amp;nbsp;pm on the night of the awards.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; this method was used until an occasion when the ''[[los angeles times]]'' announced the winners before the ceremony began; as a result, the academy has, since 1941, used a sealed envelope to reveal the name of the winners.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

this made him the first academy award winner in history. at that time, the winners were recognized for all of their work done in a certain category during the qualifying period; for example, jannings received the award for two movies in which he starred during that period, and [[janet gaynor]] later won a single oscar for performances in three films. with the fourth ceremony, however, the system changed, and professionals were honored for a specific performance in a single film. for the first six ceremonies, the eligibility period spanned two calendar years.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;  at the 29th ceremony, held on march 27, 1957, the [[academy award for best foreign language film|best foreign language film]] category was introduced. until then, foreign-language films had been honored with the special achievement award.  the 74th academy awards, held in 2002, presented the first [[academy award for best animated feature]].  since 1973, all academy awards ceremonies have ended with the [[academy award for best picture]].  traditionally, the actors present the awards for actresses and the actresses present the awards for actors.  ==oscar statuette==  ===other awards presented by the academy=== :''see also {{section link| |special categories}} (below).'' in addition to the academy award of merit (oscar award), there are nine honorary (non-competitive) awards presented by the academy from time to time (except for the academy honorary award, the technical achievement award, and the student academy awards, which are presented annually): * [[governors awards]]: ** the [[academy honorary award]] (annual) (which may or may not be in the form of an oscar statuette);

[[black tie]] dress is the most common outfit for men, although fashion may dictate not wearing a [[bow-tie]], and musical performers sometimes do not adhere to this. (the artists who recorded the nominees for best original song quite often perform those songs live at the awards ceremony, and the fact that they are performing is often used to promote the television broadcast.)  the academy awards is the only awards show that is televised live in all united states time zones (excluding hawaii;

the academy has also produced condensed versions of the ceremony for broadcast in international markets (especially those outside of the americas) in more desirable local timeslots. the ceremony was broadcast live internationally for the first time via satellite in 1970, but only two south american countries, chile and brazil, purchased the rights to air the broadcast. by that time, the television rights to the academy awards had been sold in 50 countries. a decade later, the rights were already being sold to 60 countries, and by 1984, the tv rights to the awards were licensed in 76 countries.  the ceremonies were moved up from late march or early april to late february or early march starting in 2004 to help disrupt and shorten the intense [[for your consideration (advertising)|lobbying and ad campaigns]] associated with [[oscar season]] in the film industry. another reason was because of the growing tv ratings success of the [[ncaa division i men's basketball tournament]], which would cut into the academy awards audience. the earlier date is also to the advantage of abc, as it now usually occurs during the highly profitable and important february [[sweeps]] period. some years, the ceremony is moved into early march in deference to the [[winter olympic games|winter olympics]]. another reason for the move to late february and early march is to avoid the awards ceremony occurring so close to the religious holidays of [[passover]] and [[easter]], which for decades had been a grievance from members and the general public. advertising is somewhat restricted, however, as traditionally no movie studios or competitors of official academy award sponsors may advertise during the telecast. the awards show holds the distinction of having won the most [[emmy awards|emmys]] in history, with 47 wins and 195 nominations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://goldderby.latimes.com/awards_goldderby/2010/07/emmys-love-for-oscars-continues-with-12-nominations.html|title = emmys love for oscars continues with 12 nominations |work=los angeles times |author=tom o'neil|date= 12 july 2010|accessdate = 13 august 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100819172053/http://goldderby.latimes.com/awards_goldderby/2010/07/emmys-love-for-oscars-continues-with-12-nominations.html| archivedate= 19 august 2010 &lt;!--dashbot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''international atomic time''' ('''tai''', from the french name '''{{lang|fr|''temps atomique international''}}'''&lt;ref&gt;temps atomique 1975&lt;/ref&gt;) is a high-precision atomic [[coordinate time|coordinate]] [[time standard]] based on the notional passage of [[proper time]] on [[earth]]'s [[geoid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1986cemec..38..155g |title=is the international atomic time tai a coordinate time or a proper time? |publisher=adsabs.harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=8 may 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is the principal realisation of [[terrestrial time]] (except for a fixed offset of epoch). it is also the basis for [[coordinated universal time]] (utc), which is used for civil timekeeping all over the earth's surface. {{as of|2016|12|31}} when another [[leap second]] was added,&lt;ref name="bulletin c 52"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hpiers.obspm.fr/eoppc/bul/bulc/bulletinc.52|first=christian|last=bizouard|title=bulletin c 52|publisher=[[iers]]|location=paris|date=6 july 2016|accessdate=31 december 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; tai is exactly 37 seconds ahead of utc. the 37 seconds results from the initial difference of 10 seconds at the start of 1972, plus 27 leap seconds in utc since 1972.  tai may be reported using traditional means of specifying days, carried over from non-uniform time standards based on the rotation of the earth. specifically, both [[julian date]]s and the [[gregorian calendar]] are used. tai in this form was synchronised with [[universal time]] at the beginning of 1958, and the two have drifted apart ever since, due to the changing motion of the earth.  ==operation== tai as a time scale is a [[weighted average]] of the time kept by over 400 [[atomic clock]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iag.dgfi.tum.de/fileadmin/iag-docs/travaux2013/08_bipm.pdf |title=bureau international des poids et mesures (bipm)  time department |publisher=report of the international association of geodesy 2011-2013 |date= |accessdate=11 april 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in over 50 national laboratories worldwide.&lt;ref name="time n.d."&gt;{{cite web  |title = time |url=http://www.bipm.org/en/scientific/tai/  |publisher = international bureau of weights and measures  |access-date = 22 may 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt; the clocks are compared using [[global positioning system|gps]] signals and [[two-way satellite time and frequency transfer]].&lt;ref&gt;circular t 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  due to the [[signal averaging]] it is an order of magnitude more stable than its best clock alone would be. the majority of the clocks are [[atomic clock|caesium clocks]]; the definition of the [[international system of units|si]] [[second]] is written in terms of [[caesium]].&lt;ref name=mccarthy2009/&gt;{{rp|207, 214}}  the participating institutions each broadcast, in [[real-time data|real time]], a frequency signal with [[timecode]]s, which is their estimate of tai.  time codes are usually published in the form of utc, which differs from tai by a well-known integer number of seconds.  these time scales are denoted in the form ''utc(npl)'' in the utc form, where ''npl'' in this case identifies the [[national physical laboratory, uk]].  the tai form may be denoted ''tai(npl)''.  the latter is not to be confused with ''ta(npl)'', which denotes an independent atomic time scale, not synchronised to tai or to anything else.  the clocks at different institutions are regularly compared against each other.  the [[international bureau of weights and measures]] (bipm, france), combines these measurements to retrospectively calculate the weighted average that forms the most stable time scale possible.&lt;ref name="time n.d."/&gt;  this combined time scale is published monthly in [ftp://ftp2.bipm.fr/pub/tai/publication/cirt/ circular t], and is the [[canonical form|canonical]] tai.  this time scale is expressed in the form of tables of differences utc-utc(''k'') (equivalent to tai-tai(''k'')) for each participating institution ''k''.

"nondependence of frequency on mass: a differential experiment" {{doi|10.1126/science.162.3860.1387}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in the 1970s, it became clear that the clocks participating in tai were ticking at different rates due to [[gravitational time dilation]], and the combined tai scale therefore corresponded to an average of the altitudes of the various clocks.  starting from julian date 2443144.5 (1 january 1977 00:00:00), corrections were applied to the output of all participating clocks, so that tai would correspond to proper time at [[mean sea level]] (the geoid).  because the clocks had been on average well above sea level, this meant that tai slowed down, by about one part in a trillion.  the former uncorrected time scale continues to be published, under the name ''eal'' (''echelle atomique libre'', meaning ''free atomic scale'').&lt;ref name=mccarthy2009/&gt;{{rp|215}}  the instant that the gravitational correction started to be applied serves as the epoch for [[barycentric coordinate time]] (tcb), [[geocentric coordinate time]] (tcg), and [[terrestrial time]] (tt), which represent three fundamental time scales in the solar system.&lt;ref&gt;brumberg v.a. &amp; kopeikin s.m., "relativistic time scales in the solar system", cel. mech. dyn. astron., vol. 48, pp. 23 - 44, 1990 http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1990cemda..48...23b&lt;/ref&gt;  all three of these time scales were defined to read jd 2443144.5003725 (1 january 1977 00:00:32.184) exactly at that instant.

 altruism in biological organisms can be defined as an individual performing an action which is at a cost to themselves (e.g., pleasure and quality of life, time, probability of survival or reproduction), but benefits, either directly or indirectly, another third-party individual, without the expectation of reciprocity or compensation for that action. steinberg suggests a definition for altruism in the clinical setting, that is "intentional and voluntary actions that aim to enhance the welfare of another person in the absence of any quid pro quo external rewards".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = |title = altruism in medicine: its definition, nature, and dilemmas|last = steinberg|first = david|date = 2010|journal = cambridge quarterly of healthcare ethics |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=249&#x2013;57|doi = 10.1017/s0963180109990521|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  altruism can be distinguished from feelings of [[loyalty]], in that whilst the latter is predicated upon social relationships, altruism does not consider relationships. much debate exists as to whether ''"true"'' altruism is possible in human psychology. the theory of [[psychological egoism]] suggests that no act of sharing, helping or sacrificing can be described as truly altruistic, as the actor may receive an [[intrinsic]]{{disambiguation needed|date=september 2016}} reward in the form of personal [[gratification]]. the validity of this argument depends on whether [[motivation#intrinsic and extrinsic motivation|intrinsic rewards]] qualify as "benefits". the actor also may not be expecting a reward.  the term ''[[altruism (ethics)|altruism]]'' may also refer to an ethical doctrine that claims that individuals are morally obliged to benefit others. used in this sense, it is usually contrasted with [[ethical egoism|egoism]], which is defined as acting to the benefit of one's self.  ==the notion of altruism== the concept has a long history in [[philosophy|philosophical]] and [[ethics|ethical]] thought. the term was originally coined in the 19th century by the founding [[sociologist]] and [[philosopher of science]], [[auguste comte]], and has become a major topic for [[psychologists]] (especially [[evolutionary psychology]] researchers), [[evolutionary biologists]], and [[ethology|ethologists]]. whilst ideas about altruism from one field can affect the other fields, the different methods and focuses of these fields always lead to different perspectives on altruism. in simple terms, altruism is caring about the welfare of other people and acting to help them.  ==scientific viewpoints&lt;!--linked from 'evolution of morality'--&gt;==  ===anthropology=== [[marcel mauss]]'s book ''the gift'' contains a passage called "note on alms". this note describes the evolution of the notion of alms (and by extension of altruism) from the notion of sacrifice. in it, he writes:  &lt;blockquote&gt;alms are the fruits of a moral notion of the gift and of fortune on the one hand, and of a notion of sacrifice, on the other. generosity is an obligation, because nemesis avenges the poor and the gods for the superabundance of happiness and wealth of certain people who should rid themselves of it. this is the ancient morality of the gift, which has become a principle of justice. the gods and the spirits accept that the share of wealth and happiness that has been offered to them and had been hitherto destroyed in useless sacrifices should serve the poor and children.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

that animals and humans are more altruistic towards close kin than to distant kin and non-kin has been confirmed in numerous studies across many different cultures. even subtle cues indicating kinship may unconsciously increase altruistic behavior. one kinship cue is facial resemblance. one study found that slightly altering photographs so that they more closely resembled the faces of study participants increased the trust the participants expressed regarding depicted persons. another cue is having the same family name, especially if rare, and this has been found to increase helpful behavior. another study found more cooperative behavior the greater the number of perceived kin in a group. using kinship terms in political speeches increased audience agreement with the speaker in one study. this effect was especially strong for firstborns, who are typically close to their families.&lt;ref name=aep1/&gt;

 ::a tendency towards reciprocity implies that people will feel obligated to respond if someone helps them. this has been used by charities that give small gifts to potential donors hoping thereby to induce reciprocity. another method is to announce publicly that someone has given a large donation. the tendency to reciprocate can even generalize so people become more helpful toward others in general after being helped. on the other hand, people will avoid or even retaliate against those perceived not to be cooperating. people sometimes mistakenly fail to help when they intended to, or their helping may not be noticed, which may cause unintended conflicts. as such, it may be an optimal strategy to be slightly forgiving of and have a slightly generous interpretation of non-cooperation.&lt;ref name=aep1/&gt;  ::people are more likely to cooperate on a task if they can communicate with one another first. this may be due to better assessments of cooperativeness or due to exchange of promises. they are more cooperative if they can gradually build trust, instead of being asked to give extensive help immediately. direct reciprocity and cooperation in a group can be increased by changing the focus and incentives from intra-group competition to larger scale competitions such as between groups or against the general population. thus, giving grades and promotions based only on an individual's performance relative to a small local group, as is common, may reduce cooperative behaviors in the group.&lt;ref name=aep1/&gt;

 the study of altruism was the initial impetus behind [[george r. price]]'s development of the [[price equation]], which is a mathematical equation used to study genetic evolution. an interesting example of altruism is found in the cellular [[slime mould]]s, such as ''[[dictyostelid|dictyostelium]] mucoroides.'' these protists live as individual [[amoeba]]e until starved, at which point they aggregate and form a multicellular fruiting body in which some cells sacrifice themselves to promote the survival of other cells in the fruiting body.  selective investment theory proposes that close social bonds, and associated emotional, cognitive, and neurohormonal mechanisms, evolved in order to facilitate long-term, high-cost altruism between those closely depending on one another for survival and reproductive success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1207/s15327965pli1701_01 |last1=brown |first1=s.l. |last2=brown |first2=r.m. |year=2006 |title=selective investment theory: recasting the functional significance of close relationships |url=http://icos.groups.si.umich.edu/brown-stephanie.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714230521/http://icos.groups.si.umich.edu/brown-stephanie.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-07-14 |format=pdf |journal=psychological inquiry |volume=17 |pages=1&#x2013;29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icts.res.in/media/uploads/talk/document/stlouis2011telmofin.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

 ==religious viewpoints== {{see also|evolutionary origin of religions}} most, if not all, of the world's religions promote altruism as a very important moral value. [[buddhism]], [[christianity]], [[hinduism]], [[islam]], [[jainism]], [[judaism]], and [[sikhism]], etc., place particular emphasis on altruistic morality.  ===buddhism=== [[file:monks collecting alms - bun vat phu.jpg|thumb|monks collecting alms]] altruism figures prominently in buddhism. love and compassion are components of all forms of buddhism, and are focused on all beings equally: love is the wish that all beings be happy, and compassion is the wish that all beings be free from suffering. "many illnesses can be cured by the one medicine of love and compassion. these qualities are the ultimate source of human happiness, and the need for them lies at the very core of our being" (dalai lama).&lt;ref name="speech by the dalai lama"&gt;[http://www.dalailama.com/page.65.htm speech by the dalai lama]&lt;br&gt;the phrase "core of our being" is [[freudian]]; see {{cite journal | author = bettina bock von w&#xfc;lfingen | year = 2013 | title = freud's 'core of our being' between cytology and psychoanalysis | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bewi.201301604/pdf | journal = berichte zur wissenschaftsgeschichte | volume = 36 | pages = 226&#x2013;244 | doi = 10.1002/bewi.201301604 | issue = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  since "all beings" includes the individual, love and compassion in buddhism are outside the opposition between self and other. it is even said that the distinction between self and other is part of the root cause of our suffering. in practical terms, however, since most of us are spontaneously self-centered, buddhism encourages us to focus love and compassion on others, and thus can be characterized as "altruistic." many would agree with the [[dalai lama]] that buddhism, as a religion, is kindness toward others.{{weasel inline|date=april 2016}}  still, the notion of altruism is modified in such a world-view, since the belief is that such a practice promotes our own happiness: "the more we care for the happiness of others, the greater our own sense of well-being becomes" (dalai lama&lt;ref name="speech by the dalai lama"/&gt;).  in the context of larger ethical discussions on moral action and judgment, buddhism is characterized by the belief that negative (unhappy) consequences of our actions derive not from punishment or correction based on moral judgment, but from the law of karma, which functions like a natural law of cause and effect. a simple illustration of such cause and effect is the case of experiencing the effects of what one causes: if one causes suffering, then as a natural consequence one would experience suffering; if one causes happiness, then as a natural consequence one would experience happiness.  {{main|karma in buddhism}} in buddhism, ''karma'' (p&#x101;li ''kamma'') is strictly distinguished from '''''[[vipaka|vip&#x101;ka]]''''', meaning "fruit" or "result". karma is categorized within the group or groups of cause (p&#x101;li ''hetu'') in the [[twelve nidanas|chain]] of [[pratitya-samutpada|cause and effect]], where it comprises the elements of "volitional activities" (pali ''sankhara'') and "action" (pali ''bhava''). any action is understood to create "seeds" in the mind that sprout into the appropriate results (p&#x101;li ''vipaka'') when they meet the right conditions. most types of karmas, with good or bad results, will keep one in the wheel of [[samsara (buddhism)|sams&#x101;ra]]; others will liberate one to [[nirvana|nirv&#x101;na]].  buddhism relates karma directly to motives behind an action. motivation usually makes the difference between "good" and "bad", but motivation also includes the aspect of ignorance; so a well-intended action from an ignorant mind can easily be "bad" in that it creates unpleasant results for the "actor."  in buddhism, karma is not the only cause of all that happens. as taught in the early texts, the commentarial tradition classified causal mechanisms governing the universe in five categories, known as niyama dhammas:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = davids| first = rhys| title = buddhism| url = https://books.google.com/?id=lljcz_lbel0c&amp;pg=pa119| year = 2007| publisher = lightning source incorporated| isbn = 978-1-4067-5628-9| page = 119 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = padmasiri de silva| title = environmental philosophy and ethics in buddhism| url = https://books.google.com/?id=m4t3c6ndfzic&amp;pg=pa41| year = 1998| publisher = palgrave macmillan| isbn = 978-0-312-21316-9| page = 41 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

nature's tendency to produce a perfect type  ===jainism=== {{see also|ahimsa in jainism}} [[file:ahinsa.jpg|thumb|sculpture depicting the jain concept of ''ahimsa'' (non-injury)]] the fundamental principles of [[jainism]] revolve around the concept of altruism, not only for humans but for all sentient beings. jainism preaches the view of ''[[ahimsa]]'' &#x2013; to live and let live, thereby not harming sentient beings, i.e. uncompromising reverence for all life. it also considers all living things to be equal. the first [[tirthankara]], [[rishabhdev]] introduced the concept of altruism for all living beings, from extending knowledge and experience to others to donation, giving oneself up for others, non-violence and compassion for all living things.  jainism prescribes a path of non-violence to progress the soul to this ultimate goal. a major characteristic of jain belief is the emphasis on the consequences of not only physical but also mental behaviors. one's unconquered mind with anger, pride (ego), deceit, greed and uncontrolled sense organs are the powerful enemies of humans. anger spoils good relations, pride destroys humility, deceit destroys peace and greed destroys everything. jainism recommends conquering anger by forgiveness, pride by humility, deceit by straight-forwardness and greed by contentment.  jains believe that to attain enlightenment and ultimately liberation, one must practice the following ethical principles (major vows) in thought, speech and action. the degree to which these principles are practiced is different for householders and monks. they are: # non-violence (ahimsa); # truthfulness (satya); # non-stealing (asteya); # celibacy (brahmacharya); # [[non-possession]] or non-materialism (aparigraha); the "great vows" ([[mahavrata]]) are prescribed for monks and "limited vows" ([[anuvrata]]) are prescribed for householders. the house-holders are encouraged to practice the above-mentioned five vows. the monks have to observe them very strictly. with consistent practice, it will be possible to overcome the limitations gradually, accelerating the spiritual progress.  the principle of non-violence seeks to minimize karmas which limit the capabilities of the soul. jainism views every [[soul (jainism)|soul]] as worthy of respect because it has the potential to become ''siddha'' ([[god in jainism]]). because all living beings possess a soul, great care and awareness is essential in one's actions. jainism emphasizes the equality of all life, advocating harmlessness towards all, whether the creatures are great or small. this policy extends even to microscopic organisms. jainism acknowledges that every person has different capabilities and capacities to practice and therefore accepts different levels of compliance for ascetics and householders.  ===christianity=== [[file:stthomasmount theresa.jpg|thumb|statue of [[mother teresa]] in india]] altruism is central to the teachings of jesus found in the [[gospel]], especially in the [[sermon on the mount]] and the [[sermon on the plain]]. from biblical to medieval [[christian traditions]], tensions between self-affirmation and other-regard were sometimes discussed under the heading of "disinterested love", as in the [[paul the apostle|pauline]] phrase "love seeks not its own interests." in his book ''indoctrination and self-deception,'' roderick hindery tries to shed light on these tensions by contrasting them with impostors of authentic self-affirmation and altruism, by analysis of other-regard within creative individuation of the self, and by contrasting love for the few with love for the many. love confirms others in their freedom, shuns propaganda and masks, assures others of its presence, and is ultimately confirmed not by mere declarations from others, but by each person's experience and practice from within. as in practical arts, the presence and meaning of love becomes validated and grasped not by words and reflections alone, but in the making of the connection.  [[st thomas aquinas]] interprets 'you should love your neighbour as yourself'&lt;ref&gt;[[leviticus]] 19 and matthew 22&lt;/ref&gt; as meaning that love for ourselves is the exemplar of love for others.&lt;ref&gt;''[[summa theologica]]'', ii:ii quaestio 25, article 4&lt;/ref&gt; considering that "the love with which a man loves himself is the form and root of friendship" and quotes aristotle that "the origin of friendly relations with others lies in our relations to ourselves,"&lt;ref&gt;[[nichomachean ethics]] ix.4 1166a1&lt;/ref&gt; he concluded that though we are not bound to love others more than ourselves, we naturally seek the common good, the good of the whole, more than any private good, the good of a part. however, he thinks we should love god more than ourselves and our neighbours, and more than our bodily life&#x2014;since the ultimate purpose of loving our neighbour is to share in eternal beatitude: a more desirable thing than bodily well being. in coining the word altruism, as stated above, [[auguste comte|comte]] was probably opposing this thomistic doctrine, which is present in some theological schools within catholicism.  many biblical authors draw a strong connection between love of others and love of god. 1 john 4 states that for one to love god one must love his fellowman, and that hatred of one's fellowman is the same as hatred of god. [[thomas jay oord]] has argued in several books that altruism is but one possible form of love. an altruistic action is not always a loving action. oord defines altruism as acting for the other's good, and he agrees with feminists who note that sometimes love requires acting for one's own good when the other's demands undermine overall well-being.  german philosopher [[max scheler]] distinguishes two ways in which the strong can help the weak. one way is a sincere expression of christian love, "motivated by a powerful feeling of security, strength, and inner salvation, of the invincible fullness of one&#x2019;s own life and existence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=scheler|first=max|title=ressentiment|year=1961|pages=88&#x2013;89}}&lt;/ref&gt; another way is merely "one of the many modern substitutes for love, ... nothing but the urge to turn away from oneself and to lose oneself in other people&#x2019;s business."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=scheler|first=max|title=ressentiment|year=1961|pages=95&#x2013;96}}&lt;/ref&gt; at its worst, scheler says, "love for the small, the poor, the weak, and the oppressed is really disguised hatred, repressed envy, an impulse to detract, etc., directed against the opposite phenomena: wealth, strength, power, largesse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=scheler|first=max|title=ressentiment|year=1961|pages=96&#x2013;97}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ===islam=== in [[islam]], the concept '&#x12b;th&#x101;r' (&#x625;&#x64a;&#x62b;&#x627;&#x631;) (altruism) is the notion of 'preferring others to oneself'. for sufis, this means devotion to others through complete forgetfulness of one's own concerns, where concern for others is rooted to be a demand made by allah on the human body, considered to be property of allah alone. the importance lies in sacrifice for the sake of the greater good; [[islam]] considers those practicing &#x12b;th&#x101;r as abiding by the highest degree of nobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = m| title = key concepts in the practice of sufism: emerald hills of the heart| year = 2004| publisher = fountain| location = rutherford, n.j.| isbn = 1-932099-75-1| pages = 10&#x2013;11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; this is similar to the notion of chivalry, but unlike that european concept, in i'thar attention is focused on everything in existence. a constant concern for [[allah]] (i.e. god) results in a careful attitude towards people, animals, and other things in this world.&lt;ref name="neusner2005"&gt;{{cite book| last = neusner| first = jacob eds| title = altruism in world religions| year = 2005| publisher = georgetown univ. press| location = washington, d.c.| isbn = 1-58901-065-5| pages = 79&#x2013;80 }}&lt;/ref&gt; this concept was emphasized by sufis of islam like [[rabia al-adawiyya]] who paid attention to the difference between dedication to [[allah]] (i.e. god) and dedication to people. thirteenth-century turkish sufi poet [[yunus emre]] explained this philosophy as "yarat&#x131;lan&#x131; severiz, yaratandan &#xf6;t&#xfc;r&#xfc;" or ''we love the creature, because of the creator.'' for many muslims, i'thar must be practiced as a religious obligation during specific islamic holidays. however, i'thar is also still an islamic ideal to which all muslims should strive to adhere at all times.  ===judaism=== judaism defines altruism as the desired goal of creation. the famous rabbi [[abraham isaac kook]] stated that love is the most important attribute in humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author2=ben zion bokser |last1=kook |first1=abraham isaac| title = abraham isaac kook: the lights of penitence, the moral principles, lights of holiness, essays, letters, and poems| year = 1978| publisher = paulist press| isbn = 978-0-8091-2159-5| pages = 135&#x2013;136}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is defined as [[tzedakah|bestowal]], or giving, which is the intention of altruism. this can be altruism towards humanity that leads to altruism towards the creator or god. [[kabbalah]] defines god as the force of giving in [[existence]]. rabbi [[moshe chaim luzzatto]] in particular focused on the 'purpose of creation' and how the will of god was to bring creation into perfection and adhesion with this upper force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = luzzatto| first = moshe &#x1e24;ayyim| title = the way of god| year = 1997| publisher = feldheim publishers| isbn = 978-0-87306-769-0| pages = 37&#x2013;38}}&lt;/ref&gt;  modern kabbalah developed by rabbi [[yehuda ashlag]], in his writings about the future generation, focuses on how society could achieve an altruistic social framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = ashlag| first = yehuda| title = building the future society| url = http://www.kabbalah.info/eng/content/view/frame/3811?/eng/content/view/full/3811&amp;main| year = 2006| publisher = laitman kabbalah publishers| location = thornhill, canada| isbn = 965-7065-34-8| pages = 120&#x2013;130 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ashlag proposed that such a framework is the purpose of creation, and everything that happens is to raise humanity to the level of altruism, love for one another. ashlag focused on society and its relation to [[divinity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = ashlag| first = yehuda| title = building the future society| url = http://www.kabbalah.info/eng/content/view/frame/3811?/eng/content/view/full/3811&amp;main| year = 2006| publisher = laitman kabbalah publishers| location = thornhill, canada| isbn = 965-7065-34-8| pages = 175&#x2013;180 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ===sikhism=== altruism is essential to the sikh religion.  the central faith in sikhism is that the greatest deed any one can do is to imbibe and live the godly qualities like love, affection, sacrifice, patience, harmony, truthfulness. the fifth nanak, guru arjun dev sacrificed his life to uphold 22 carats of pure truth, the greatest gift to humanity, the guru granth.  the ninth guru , guru tegh bahadur, sacrificed his head to protect weak and defenseless people against atrocity. in the late seventeenth century, [[guru gobind singh]] ji (the tenth [[guru]] in sikhism), was in war with the [[mughal empire|mughal]] rulers to protect the people of different faiths when a fellow sikh, [[bhai kanhaiya]], attended the troops of the enemy. he gave water to both friends and foes who were wounded on the battlefield. some of the enemy began to fight again and some sikh warriors were annoyed by bhai kanhaiya as he was helping their enemy. sikh soldiers brought bhai kanhaiya before guru gobind singh ji, and complained of his action that they considered counter-productive to their struggle on the battlefield. "what were you doing, and why?" asked the guru. "i was giving water to the wounded because i saw your face in all of them," replied bhai kanhaiya. the guru responded, "then you should also give them ointment to heal their wounds. you were practicing what you were coached in the house of the guru."  it was under the tutelage of the guru that bhai kanhaiya subsequently founded a volunteer corps for altruism. this volunteer corps still to date is engaged in doing good to others and trains new volunteering recruits for doing the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = o. p. ralhan| title = the great gurus of the sikhs| year = 1997| publisher = anmol publications pvt ltd.| location = new delhi| isbn = 81-7488-479-3| page = 253 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ===hinduism=== [[swami sivananda]], an [[advaita]] scholar, reiterates the same views in his commentary synthesising vedanta views on the [[brahma sutras]], a vedantic text. in his commentary on chapter 3 of the brahma sutras, sivananda notes that karma is insentient and short-lived, and ceases to exist as soon as a deed is executed. hence, karma cannot bestow the fruits of actions at a future date according to one's merit. furthermore, one cannot argue that karma generates [[apurva]] or [[merit (buddhism)|punya]], which gives fruit. since apurva is non-sentient, it cannot act unless moved by an intelligent being such as a god. it cannot independently bestow reward or punishment.  however the very well known and popular text, the bhagavad gita supports the doctrine of karma yoga (selfless action) or action without desire for personal gain which can be said to encompass altruism. altruistic acts are generally celebrated and very well received in hindu literature and is central to hindu morality.&lt;ref&gt;sivananda, swami. ''phaladhikaranam, topic 8'', sutras 38&#x2013;41.&lt;/ref&gt;  ==philosophy== {{main|altruism (ethics)}}  there exists a wide range of philosophical views on humans' obligations or motivations to act altruistically. proponents of [[altruism (ethics)|ethical altruism]] maintain that individuals are morally obligated to act altruistically. the opposing view is [[ethical egoism]], which maintains that moral agents should always act in their own self-interest. both ethical altruism and ethical egoism contrast with [[utilitarianism]], which maintains that each agent should act in order to maximise the efficacy of their function and the benefit to both themselves and their co-inhabitants.  a related concept in [[descriptive ethics]] is [[psychological egoism]], the thesis that humans always act in their own self-interest and that true altruism is impossible. [[rational egoism]] is the view that [[rationality]] consists in acting in one's self-interest (without specifying how this affects one's moral obligations).  ==genetics== the genes [[oxtr]],

(3 april 1885 &#x2013; 28 december 1981) was a pioneering canadian-born american motion picture director, producer and screenwriter.  ==early life== born '''joseph aloysius dwan''' in [[toronto|toronto, ontario]], canada, dwan, was the younger son of commercial traveller of woolen clothing joseph michael dwan (1857&#x2013;1917) and his wife mary jane dwan, ''n&#xe9;e'' hunt. the family moved to the united states when he was seven years old, on 4 december 1892, by ferry from windsor to detroit, according to his naturalization petition of august 1939. his elder brother, leo garnet dwan (1883&#x2013;1964), became a physician. at the [[university of notre dame]], allan dwan studied engineering and began working for a lighting company in chicago. however, he had a strong interest in the fledgling motion picture industry and when [[essanay studios]] offered him the opportunity to become a scriptwriter, he took the job.&lt;ref name="kevin brownlow 1968"&gt;{{cite book |author=brownlow, kevin |title=the parade's gone by . . . |publisher=ballantine books, inc. |location=new york |year=1969 |page=111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; at that time, some of the [[east coast of the united states|east coast]] movie makers began to spend winters in california where the climate allowed them to continue productions requiring warm weather. soon, a number of movie companies worked there year-round and, in 1911, dwan began working part-time in hollywood. while still in new york, in 1917 he was the founding president of the east coast chapter of the [[motion picture directors association]].&lt;ref name="frankenstein"&gt;{{cite news |last=fournier |first=pierre |url= http://io9.gizmodo.com/5706057/the-first-frankenstein-of-the-movies |title=the first frankenstein of the

one of the first motion pictures studios in california history. on 12 august 2011, a plaque was unveiled on the wolff building at third avenue and la mesa boulevard commemorating dwan and the [[flying a studios]] origins in [[la mesa, california]].  after making a series of westerns and comedies, dwan directed fellow canadian-american [[mary pickford]] in several very successful movies as well as her husband, [[douglas fairbanks]], notably in the acclaimed 1922 ''[[robin hood (1922 film)|robin hood]]''. dwan directed [[gloria swanson]] in eight feature films, and one short film made in the short-lived sound-on-film process [[phonofilm]]. this short, also featuring [[thomas meighan]] and [[henri de la falaise]], was produced as a joke, for the 26 april 1925 "lambs' gambol" for [[the lambs]], with the film showing swanson crashing the all-male club.  following the introduction of the [[sound film|talkies]], dwan directed child-star [[shirley temple]] in ''[[heidi (1937 film)|heidi]]'' (1937) and ''[[rebecca of sunnybrook farm (1938 film)|rebecca of sunnybrook farm]]'' (1938).  dwan helped launch the career of two other successful hollywood directors, [[victor fleming]], who went on to direct ''[[the wizard of oz (1939 film)|the wizard of oz]]'' and ''[[gone with the wind (film)|gone with the wind]]'', and [[marshall neilan]], who became an actor, director, writer and producer. over a long career spanning almost 50 years, dwan directed 125 motion pictures, some of which were highly acclaimed, such as the 1949 box office hit, ''[[sands of iwo jima]]''. he directed his last movie in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

by 600 bc, a [[phoenicia]]n presence existed at [[tipasa]], east of [[cherchell]], [[hippo regius]] (modern [[annaba]]) and [[rusicade]] (modern [[skikda]]). these settlements served as market towns as well as anchorages.  as carthaginian power grew, its impact on the indigenous population increased dramatically. berber civilization was already at a stage in which agriculture, manufacturing, trade, and political organization supported several states. trade links between carthage and the berbers in the interior grew, but territorial expansion also resulted in the enslavement or military recruitment of some berbers and in the extraction of tribute from others.

the viceroy, el-mu'izz, also found another means of revenge.  between the [[nile]] and the [[red sea]] were living [[bedouin]] tribes expelled from [[arabia]] for their disruption and turbulent influence, both [[banu hilal]] and [[banu sulaym]] among others, whose presence disrupted farmers in the [[nile valley]] since the nomads would often loot. the then [[fatimid caliphate|fatimid]] vizier devised to relinquish control of the [[maghreb]] and obtained the agreement of his sovereign. this not only prompted the bedouins to leave, but the [[fatimid]] treasury even gave them a light expatriation cash allowance.  whole tribes set off with women, children, ancestors, animals and camping equipment. some stopped on the way, especially in [[cyrenaica]], where they are still one of the essential elements of the settlement but most arrived in [[ifriqiya]] by the [[gab&#xe8;s governorate|gabe]]s region. the [[zirid]] ruler tried to stop this rising tide, but each meeting, the last under the walls of [[kairouan]], his troops were defeated and arabs remained masters of the field.  the flood was still rising, and in 1057 the arabs spread on the high plains of [[constantine, algeria|constantine]] where they gradually choked [[beni hammad fort|qalaa of banu hammad]], as they had done kairouan few decades ago. from there they gradually gained the upper [[algiers]] and [[oran]] plains. some were forcibly taken by the [[almohads]] in the second half of the 12th century. we can say that in the 13th century there were in all of [[north africa]], with the exception of the main mountain ranges and certain coastal regions remained entirely berber.  ===privateers era=== {{main article|ottoman algeria}} [[file:magr&#xe8;b s&#xe8;gle xv-es.svg|thumb|the zayyanid kingdom of tlemcen in the fifteenth century and its neighbors]] [[file:barbarossa hayreddin pasha.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[hayreddin barbarossa]]]]  the region of algeria was partially ruled by [[ottomans]] for three centuries from 1516 to 1830. in 1516 the [[turkish people|turkish]] privateer brothers [[aruj]] and [[hayreddin barbarossa]], who operated successfully under the [[hafsids]], moved their base of operations to algiers. they succeeded in conquering jijel and algiers from the [[spaniards]] but eventually assumed control over the city and the surrounding region, forcing the previous ruler, abu hamo musa iii of the ''bani ziyad'' dynasty, to flee.&lt;ref&gt;[[hayreddin barbarossa#rulers of algiers]]&lt;/ref&gt; when aruj was killed in 1518 during his invasion of [[kingdom of tlemcen|tlemcen]], hayreddin succeeded him as military commander of algiers. the [[ottoman empire|ottoman]] sultan gave him the title of [[beylerbey]] and a contingent of some 2,000 [[janissaries]]. with the aid of this force, hayreddin conquered the whole area between constantine and oran (although the city of oran remained in spanish hands until 1791).&lt;ref name="csa16" /&gt;  the next beylerbey was hayreddin's son [[hasan pasha (son of barbarossa)|hasan]], who assumed the position in 1544. until 1587 the area was governed by officers who served terms with no fixed limits. subsequently, with the institution of a regular ottoman administration, governors with the title of pasha ruled for three-year terms. the pasha was assisted by janissaries, known in algeria as the ojaq and led by an [[agha (ottoman empire)|agha]]. discontent among the ojaq rose in the mid-1600s because they were not paid regularly, and they repeatedly revolted against the pasha. as a result, the agha charged the pasha with corruption and incompetence and seized power in 1659.&lt;ref name="csa16" /&gt;  [[plague (disease)|plague]] had repeatedly struck the cities of north africa. algiers lost from 30,000 to 50,000 inhabitants to the plague in 1620&#x2013;21, and suffered high fatalities in 1654&#x2013;57, 1665, 1691 and 1740&#x2013;42.&lt;ref name="davis" /&gt;

but by the 18th century, it had become the dey's instrument. in 1710, the dey persuaded the sultan to recognise him and his successors as regent, replacing the [[pasha]] in that role, although algiers remained a part of the ottoman empire.&lt;ref name="csa16" /&gt;  the dey was in effect a constitutional autocrat. the dey was elected for a life term, but in the 159 years (1671&#x2013;1830) that the system survived, fourteen of the twenty-nine deys were assassinated. despite usurpation, military coups and occasional mob rule, the day-to-day operation of ottoman government was remarkably orderly. although the regency patronised the tribal chieftains, it never had the unanimous allegiance of the countryside, where heavy taxation frequently provoked unrest. autonomous tribal states were tolerated, and the regency's authority was seldom applied in the [[kabylie]].&lt;ref name="csa16"&gt;{{cite web|title=algeria&amp;nbsp;&#x2013;

{{displaytitle:list of ''atlas shrugged'' characters}} this is a list of characters in [[ayn rand]]'s novel ''[[atlas shrugged]].''  ==major characters== the following are major characters from the novel.&lt;ref&gt;characters are listed as "major" if they meet one of the following criteria: *they are listed as "major" characters in a widely available study guide, such as [[cliffsnotes]], [[sparknotes]], or [[gale (cengage)|gale's]] ''novels for students''; *they are listed as "primary heroic" or "arch-villain" characters in gladstein's ''the new ayn rand companion''; *they are the focus of an essay in a scholarly book about the novel, such as ''essays on ayn rand's atlas shrugged'' or ''ayn rand's atlas shrugged''.&lt;/ref&gt;  ===protagonists===  ====dagny taggart==== dagny taggart is the [[protagonist]] of the novel. she is vice-president in charge of operations for taggart transcontinental, under her brother, james taggart. given james' incompetence, dagny is responsible for all the workings of the railroad.  ====francisco d'anconia==== francisco d'anconia is one of the central characters in ''atlas shrugged'', an owner by inheritance of the world's largest [[copper]] mining operation. he is a childhood friend, and the first love, of dagny taggart. a child prodigy of exceptional talents, francisco was dubbed the "climax" of the d'anconia line, an already prestigious family of skilled industrialists. he was a classmate of john galt and ragnar danneskj&#xf6;ld and student of both hugh akston and robert stadler. he began working while still in school, proving that he could have made a fortune without the aid of his family's wealth and power. later, francisco bankrupts the d'anconia business to put it out of others' reach. his full name is given as "francisco domingo carlos andres sebasti&#xe1;n d'anconia".&lt;ref&gt;the accent in the given name ''sebasti&#xe1;n'' is in accordance with [[spanish orthography]]; however, the same rule would require writing ''andr&#xe9;s''.&lt;/ref&gt;  ====john galt==== {{main|john galt}} john galt is the primary male hero of ''atlas shrugged''. he initially appears as an unnamed menial worker for taggart transcontinental, who often dines with eddie willers in the employees' cafeteria, and leads eddie to reveal important information about dagny taggart and taggart transcontinental. only eddie's side of their conversations is given in the novel. later in the novel, the reader discovers this worker's true identity.  before working for taggart transcontinental, galt worked as an engineer for the twentieth century motor company, where he secretly invented a generator of usable electric energy from ambient static electricity, but abandoned his prototype, and his employment, when dissatisfied by an easily corrupted novel system of payment. this prototype was found by dagny taggart and hank rearden. galt himself remains concealed, throughout much of the novel, in a valley concealed by himself, where he unites the most skillful inventors and business leaders under his leadership. much of the book's third division is given to his broadcast speech, which presents the author's philosophy of objectivism.  ====henry "hank" rearden==== henry (known as "hank") rearden is one of the central characters in ''atlas shrugged''. he owns the most important steel company in the united states, and invents rearden metal, an [[alloy]] stronger than steel (with similar properties to stainless steel). he lives in [[philadelphia]] with his wife lillian, his brother philip, and his elderly mother. rearden represents a type of [[self-made man]] or prototypical hero, and illustrates rand's [[atlas shrugged#theory of sex|theory of sex]] in so far as he accepts the traditional view of sexual congress as a subhuman instinct, but responds sexually to dagny taggart. although this is not stated in the book.  ====eddie willers==== edwin "eddie" willers is the special assistant to the vice-president in charge of operations at taggart transcontinental. his father and grandfather worked for the taggarts, and himself likewise. he is completely loyal to dagny and to taggart transcontinental. willers does not possess the creative ability of galt's associates, but matches them in moral courage and is capable of appreciating and making use of their creations. after dagny shifts her attention and loyalty to saving the captive galt, willers maintains the railroad until its collapse.  ====ragnar danneskj&#xf6;ld==== one of galt's first followers, and world-famous as a [[pirate]], who seizes relief ships sent from the united states to the people's states of europe. he works to  ensure that once those espousing galt's philosophy are restored to their rightful place in society, they have enough capital to rebuild the world. kept in the background for much of the book, danneskj&#xf6;ld makes a personal appearance to encourage rearden to persevere in his increasingly difficult situation, and gives him a bar of gold as compensation for the income taxes he has paid over the last several years. danneskj&#xf6;ld is married to the actress kay ludlow; their relationship is kept hidden from the outside world, which only knows of ludlow as a retired [[film star]]. considered a misfit by galt's other adherents, he views his actions as a means to speed the world along in understanding galt's perspective.  according to [[barbara branden]], who was closely associated with rand at the time the book was written, there were sections written describing danneskj&#xf6;ld's adventures at sea, cut from the final published text.&lt;ref&gt;reedstrom, karen. [http://barbarabranden.com/interview4.html 1992 interview with full context]. barbara branden interview in ''full context'', october 1992. republished on barbarabranden.com. retrieved 1 june 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; in a 1974 comment at a lecture, ayn rand admitted that danneskj&#xf6;ld's name was a tribute to victor hugo's novel, ''hans of iceland'', wherein the hero becomes the first of the counts of danneskj&#xf6;ld. in the published book, danneskj&#xf6;ld is always seen through the eyes of others (dagny taggart or hank rearden), except for a brief paragraph in the very last chapter.  ===antagonists===  ====james taggart==== the president of taggart transcontinental and the book's most important antagonist. taggart is an expert influence peddler but incapable of making operational decisions on his own. he relies on his sister, dagny taggart, to actually run the railroad, but nonetheless opposes her in almost every endeavor because of his various anti-capitalist moral and political beliefs. in a sense, he is the antithesis of dagny. this contradiction leads to the recurring absurdity of his life: the desire to overcome those on whom his life depends, and the horror that he will succeed at this. in the final chapters of the novel, he suffers a complete mental breakdown upon realizing that he can no longer deceive himself in this respect.  ====lillian rearden==== the unsupportive wife of hank rearden, who dislikes his habits and (secretly at first) seeks to ruin rearden to prove her own value. lillian achieves this, when she passes information to james taggart about her husband's affair with his sister. this information is used to persuade rearden to sign a gift certificate which delivers all the property rights of rearden metal to others. lillian thereafter uses james taggart for sexual satisfaction, until hank abandons her.  ====dr. floyd ferris====  ferris is a biologist who works as "co-ordinator" at the state science institute. he uses his position there to deride reason and productive achievement, and publishes a book entitled ''why do you think you think?'' he clashes on several occasions with hank rearden, and twice attempts to blackmail rearden into giving up rearden metal. he is also one of the group of looters who tries to get rearden to agree to the steel unification plan. ferris hosts the demonstration of the project x weapon, and is the creator of the ferris persuader, a torture machine. when john galt is captured by the looters, ferris uses the device on galt, but it breaks down before extracting the information ferris wants from galt. ferris represents the group which uses brute force on the heroes to achieve the ends of the looters.  ====dr. robert stadler==== a former professor at patrick henry university, and along with colleague hugh akston, mentor to francisco d'anconia, john galt and ragnar danneskj&#xf6;ld. he has since become a sell-out, one who had great promise but squandered it for social approval, to the detriment of the free. he works at the state science institute where all his inventions are perverted for use by the military, including the instrument of his demise: project x (xylophone). the character was, in part, modeled on [[j. robert oppenheimer]], whom rand had interviewed for an earlier project, and his part in the creation of [[nuclear weapons]].&lt;ref&gt;david harriman, ''[[journals of ayn rand]]'', pp. 311-344, esp. 330-331.&lt;/ref&gt; to his former student galt, stadler represents the epitome of human evil, as the "man who knew better" but chose not to act for the good.  ====wesley mouch==== the incompetent and treacherous lobbyist whom hank rearden reluctantly employs in [[washington, d.c.|washington]], who rises to prominence and authority throughout the novel through trading favours and disloyalty. in return for betraying hank by helping broker the equalization of opportunity bill (which, by restricting the number of businesses each person may own to one, forces hank to divest most of his companies), he is given a senior position at the bureau of economic planning and national resources. later in the novel he becomes its top co-ordinator, a position that eventually becomes economic dictator of the country.  ==secondary characters== the following secondary characters also appear in the novel.&lt;ref&gt;secondary characters are listed if they appear in character lists from any of the works used to establish the list of major characters above, but do not meet the criteria for "major." minor characters who are not listed in secondary works are not listed here.&lt;/ref&gt;  *'''hugh akston''' is identified as "one of the last great advocates of reason." he was a renowned philosopher and the head of the department of philosophy at patrick henry university, where he taught francisco d'anconia, john galt, and ragnar danneskj&#xf6;ld. he was, along with robert stadler, a father figure to these three. akston's name is so hallowed that a young lady, on hearing that francisco had studied under him, is shocked. she thought he must have been one of those great names from an earlier century. he now works as a cook in a roadside diner, and proves extremely skillful at the job. when dagny tracks him down, and before she discovers his true identity, he rejects her enthusiastic offer to manage the dining car services for taggart transcontinental. he is based on [[aristotle]]. *'''jeff allen''' is a tramp who stows away on a taggart train during one of dagny's cross-country trips. instead of throwing him out, she allows him to ride as her guest. it is from allen that she learns the full story behind the collapse of the twentieth century motor company (rand's extensive metaphor for the inherent flaws of communism), as well as a hint of john galt's true background. *'''calvin atwood''' is owner of atwood light and power company and joins galt's strike. *'''mayor bascom''' is the mayor of rome, wisconsin, who reveals part of the history of the twentieth century motor company. *'''dr. blodgett''' is the scientist who pulls the lever to demonstrate project x. *'''orren boyle''' is the head of associated steel, antithesis of hank rearden and a friend of james taggart. he is an investor in the san sebasti&#xe1;n mines. he disappears from the story after having a nervous breakdown following the failed 'unification' of the steel industry. *'''laura bradford''' is an actress and kip chalmers's mistress. *'''bill brent''' is the chief dispatcher for the colorado division of taggart transcontinental, who tries to prevent the taggart tunnel disaster. *'''cherryl brooks''' is a dime store shopgirl who marries james taggart after a chance encounter in her store the night the john galt line was falsely deemed his greatest success. she marries him thinking he is the heroic person behind taggart transcontinental. cherryl is at first harsh towards dagny, having believed jim taggart's descriptions of his sister, until she questions employees of the railroad. upon learning that her scorn had been misdirected, cherryl puts off apologizing to dagny out of shame until the night before she commits suicide, when she confesses to dagny that when she married jim, she thought he had the heroic qualities that she had looked up to - she thought she was marrying someone like dagny. she eventually commits suicide, unable to live with her worthless husband, and unable to escape. *'''millie bush''' was "a mean, ugly little eight-year-old" girl voted to receive gold braces to straighten her teeth by the marxist "family" committee who determined how pay was allocated at the twentieth century motor company. her teeth are later knocked out by a man denied an allowance by the committee to purchase the things he valued. *'''emma chalmers''', kip chalmers' mother, gains some influence after his death. known as "kip's ma," she starts a soybean-growing project in louisiana and commandeers thousands of railcars to move the harvest. as a result, the year's wheat crop from minnesota never reaches the rest of the country, but instead rots in storage; also, the soybean crop is lost, having been reaped too early. *'''kip chalmers''' is a washington man who has decided to run for election as legislator from california. on the way to his campaign, the taggart transcontinental train that is carrying him encounters a split rail, resulting in the destruction of its diesel engine. his demands lead to a coal-burning steam engine being attached to his train in its stead and used to pull it through an eight-mile tunnel. the result is the suffocation of all passengers and the destruction of the taggart tunnel. *'''dan conway''' is the middle-aged president of the phoenix-durango railroad. running a railroad is just about the only thing he knows. when the anti-dog-eat-dog rule is used to drive his business out of [[colorado]], he loses the will to fight, and resigns himself to a quiet life of books and fishing. *'''ken danagger''' owns danagger coal in pennsylvania. he helps hank rearden illegally make rearden metal, then later decides to quit and join galt's strike moments before dagny arrives to try to persuade him otherwise. *'''quentin daniels''' is an enterprising engineer hired by dagny taggart to reconstruct john galt's motor. partway through this process, quentin withdraws his effort for the same reasons john galt himself had. dagny's pursuit of quentin leads her to galt's gulch. *'''sebastian d'anconia''' was the 16th (or 17th) century founder of the d'anconia dynasty. escaped from spain because of expressing his opinions too freely and coming in conflict with the [[inquisition]], leaving behind a palace and his beloved. started a small mine in south america, which became the beginning of a mining empire and a new fortune (and a new palace). eventually sent for his beloved who had waited for him many years. he is the role model which francisco d'anconia looks to, as dagny taggart looks to nathaniel taggart. francisco remarks that their respective ancestors would have liked each other. *'''balph eubank''' is called "the literary leader of the age", despite the fact that no book he has written has sold more than 3,000 copies. he complains that it is disgraceful that artists are treated as peddlers, and that there should be a law limiting the sales of books to 10,000 copies. he is a [[misogynist]] who thinks it disgusting that dagny taggart is a railroad vice-president. *the '''fishwife''' is one of the strikers, who earns her living by providing the fish for hammond&#x2019;s grocery market; she is described as having "dark, disheveled hair and large eyes", and is a writer. galt says she "wouldn't be published outside. she believes that when one deals with words, one deals with the mind." according to barbara branden in her book ''[[the passion of ayn rand]]'', "the [[fishwife]] is ayn's [[list of

existence that still produces top-quality vehicles. he eventually quits and joins the strike. *'''richard halley''' is dagny taggart's favorite composer, who mysteriously disappeared after the evening of his greatest triumph. halley spent years as a struggling and unappreciated composer. at age 24, his opera ''[[phaethon]]'' was performed for the first time, to an audience who booed and heckled it. after 19 years, ''phaethon'' was performed again, but this time it was received to the greatest ovation the opera house had ever heard. the following day, halley retired, sold the rights to his music, and disappeared. it is later revealed that he has joined the strike and settled in galt's gulch. *'''mrs. william hastings''' is the widow of the chief engineer at the twentieth century motor company. her husband quit shortly after galt did and joined the strike some years later. her lead allows dagny to find hugh akston. *'''dr. thomas hendricks''' is a famous brain surgeon who developed a new method of preventing strokes. he joined galt's strike when the american medical system was put under government control. *'''tinky holloway''' is one of the "looters" and is frequently referred to and quoted by other characters in the story, but he has only one major appearance: during the washington meeting with hank rearden. *'''lee hunsacker''' is in charge of a company called amalgamated service when takes over the twentieth century motor company. he files a lawsuit that eventually leads to midas mulligan and judge narragansett joining the strike. a failed businessman, he laments constantly that no-one ever gave him a chance. *'''gwen ives''' is hank rearden's secretary. *'''owen kellogg''' is assistant to the manager of the taggart terminal in new york. he catches dagny taggart's eye as one of the few competent men on staff. after seeing the sorry state of the ohio division, she decides to make him its new superintendent. however, as soon as she returns to new york, kellogg informs her that he is quitting his job. owen kellogg eventually reaches, and settles in, galt's gulch. *'''gilbert keith-worthing''' is a british novelist of erstwhile fame, now neglected but still considered a "walking classic". rand introduces him only for a few pages as a guest of kip chalmers ("for no reason that either of them could discover") to then implicitly have him asphyxiated in the tunnel catastrophe, after giving some statements. *'''fred kinnan''' is a labor leader and member of the looter cabal. unlike the others, however, kinnan is straightforward and honest about his purpose. kinnan is the only one to openly state the true motivations of himself and his fellow conspirators. at the end of galt's three-hour speech, he expresses admiration for the man, as he says what he means. despite this, kinnan admits that he is one of the people galt is out to destroy. *'''paul larkin''' is an unsuccessful, middle-aged businessman, a friend of the rearden family. he meets with the other looters to work out a plan to bring rearden down. james taggart knows he is friends with hank rearden and challenges his loyalty, and larkin assures taggart that he will go along with them. *'''eugene lawson''' heads the community bank of madison, then gets a job with the government when it his bank goes bankrupt. one of the looter's cabal, he is a collectivist who abhors production and money-making. *'''mort liddy''' is a [[hack writer|hack]] composer who writes trite scores for movies and modern symphonies to which no one listens. he believes melody is a primitive vulgarity. he is one of lillian rearden's friends and a member of the cultural elite. *'''clifton locey''' is a friend of jim taggart who takes the position of vice-president of operation when dagny taggart quits. *'''pat logan''' is the engineer on the first run of the john galt line. he later strikes. *'''kay ludlow''' is a beautiful actress and the wife of ragnar danneskj&#xf6;ld. *'''dick mcnamara''' is a contractor who finished the san sebastian line. dagny taggart plans to hire him to lay the new rearden metal track for the rio norte line, but before she does so, he mysteriously disappears. she later discovers that he has joined the strike and settled in galt's gulch. *'''cuffy meigs''' is the director of unification for the railroad business. he carries a pistol and a lucky rabbit's foot, and he dresses in a military uniform, and has been described as "impervious to thought". meigs seizes control of project x and accidentally destroys it, demolishing the country's last railroad bridge across the mississippi river and killing himself, his men, and dr. stadler. *'''dave mitchum''' is a state-hired superintendent of the colorado division of taggart transcontinental. he is partially responsible for the taggart tunnel disaster. *'''chick morrison''' holds the position of "morale conditioner" in the government. he quits when society begins to collapse and flees to a stronghold in tennessee. his fellow looters consider it unlikely that he will survive. *'''horace bussby mowen''' is the president of the amalgamated switch and signal company, inc. of connecticut. he is a businessman who sees nothing wrong with the moral code that is destroying society and would never dream of saying he is in business for any reason other than the good of society. dagny taggart hires mowen to produce switches made of rearden metal. he is reluctant to build anything with this unproven technology, and has to be cajoled into accepting the contract. when pressured by public opinion, he discontinues production of the switches, forcing dagny to find an alternative source. *'''midas mulligan''' is a wealthy banker who mysteriously disappeared in protest after he was given a court order to lend money to an incompetent applicant. when the order came down, he liquidated his entire business, paid off his depositors, and joined galt's strike. he is the legal owner of the land where galt's gulch is located. mulligan's birth name was michael, but he had it legally changed after a news article called him "[[midas]]" in a derogatory fashion, which mulligan took as a compliment. *'''judge narragansett''' is an american jurist who ruled in favor of midas mulligan during the case brought against him by the incompetent loan applicant. when narragansett's ruling was reversed on appeal, he retired and joined the strike. at the end of the novel, he is seen editing the [[united states constitution]], crossing out the contradicting amendments of it and adding an amendment to prohibit congress from passing laws that restrain freedom of trade. *'''ben nealy''' is a railroad contractor whom dagny taggart hires to replace the track on the rio norte line with rearden metal. nealy is incompetent, but dagny can find no one better in all the country. nealy believes that anything can get done with enough muscle power. he sees no role for intelligence in human achievement. he relies on dagny and ellis wyatt to run things, and resents them for doing it, because it appears to him like they are just bossing people around. *'''ted nielsen''' is the head of nielsen motors. he eventually goes on strike, along with most of the other industrialist "producer" types, by closing his motor factory. dagny later finds him when she visits galt's gulch for the first time. *'''betty pope''' is a wealthy socialite who is having a meaningless sexual affair with james taggart. she is deliberately crude in a way that casts ridicule on her high social position. *'''dr. potter''' holds some undefined position with the state science institute. he is sent to try to obtain the rights to rearden metal. *'''dr. simon pritchett''' is the prestigious head of the department of philosophy at patrick henry university and is considered the leading philosopher of the age. he believes that man is nothing but a collection of chemicals, reason is a superstition, it is futile to seek meaning in life, and the duty of a philosopher is to show that nothing can be understood. *'''rearden's mother''', whose name is not mentioned, lives with rearden at his home in philadelphia. she is involved in charity work, and berates rearden whenever she can. she dotes on her weak son philip rearden. *'''philip rearden''' is the younger brother of hank rearden. he lives in his brother's home in philadelphia and is completely dependent on him. he is resentful of his brother's charity. *'''dwight sanders''' owns sanders aircraft, a producer of high-quality airplanes, and joins the strike. *'''bertram scudder''' is an editorial writer for the magazine ''the future''. he typically bashes business and businessmen, but he never says anything specific in his articles, relying on innuendo, sneers, and denunciation. he wrote a hatchet job on hank rearden called ''the octopus''. he is also vocal in support of the equalization of opportunity bill. scudder claims that the most important thing in life is "brother love" but seems to have nothing but hatred for those around him. he loses his job after dagny taggart reveals her affair with hank rearden over air on his radio show. *'''claude slagenhop''' is president of political organization friends of global progress and one of lillian rearden's friends. he believes that ideas are just air, that this is no time for talk, but for action. global progress is a sponsor of the equalization of opportunity bill. *'''gerald and ivy starnes''' are the two surviving children of jed starnes, the founder of the twentieth century motor company. together with their since-deceased brother eric, they instituted a communistic payment-and-benefits program that drove the company into bankruptcy. gerald, a dying alcoholic, and ivy, a [[new age|pseudo-buddhist]] ascetic, continue to insist that the plan was perfect and that the failure of their father's company was entirely due to the workers. eric was a weak, attention-seeking man with a pathological desire to be loved. he committed suicide after the woman he loved married another man. gerald claims that he always acted for the good of the employees, but he was vain and incompetent and often threw lavish parties using company funds. ivy, on the other hand, is described as a sadist who relishes seeing others in poverty, but who has no desire for wealth of her own. *'''andrew stockton''' runs the stockton foundry in stockton, colorado. when he joins the strike, he opens a foundry in galt's gulch. *'''nathaniel "nat" taggart''' was the founder of taggart transcontinental. he built his railroad without any government handouts, and ran the business for no other reason than to turn a profit. he began as a penniless adventurer and ended up as one of the wealthiest men in the country. he never earned money by force or fraud (except for bribing government officials and throwing an opponent down a flight of stairs), and never apologized for becoming wealthy and successful. he was one of the most hated men of his time. dagny is often inspired by looking at a statue of nat taggart at the railroad headquarters, and draws a dollar sign on its base as a signal to francisco when she is ready to join galt's strike.  it is suspected that he is modeled after james jerome hill, builder of the great northern railroad.  *'''mr. thompson''' is the "[[head of state|head of the state]]" for the united states. he is not particularly intelligent and has a very undistinguished look. he knows politics, however, and is a master of public relations and back-room deals. rand's notes indicate that she modeled him on president [[harry s. truman]], and that she deliberately decided not to call him "president of the united states" as this title has "honorable connotations" which the character does not deserve. *'''lester tuck''' is the press agent for kip chalmers. *'''clem weatherby''' is a government representative on the board of directors of taggart transcontinental. dagny considers him the least bad of the government representatives, since he does have some real knowledge on the running of trains. she notices, however, that he is the least appreciated by his own bosses. *the '''wet nurse (tony)''' is a young bureaucrat sent by the government to watch over rearden&#x2019;s mills. though he starts out as a cynical follower of the looters&#x2019; code, his experience at the mills transforms him, and he comes to respect and admire the producers. he is shot attempting to inform hank rearden about a government plot, but does succeed in warning rearden just before he dies. *'''ellis wyatt''' is the head of wyatt oil. he has almost single-handedly revived the economy of colorado by discovering a new process for extracting more oil from what were thought to be exhausted oil wells. when first introduced, he is aggressive towards dagny, whom he does not yet know and whom he blames for what are, in fact, her brother's policies which directly threaten his business. when the government passes laws and decrees which make it impossible for him to continue, he sets all his oil wells on fire, leaving a jeering note: "i am leaving it as i found it. take over. it's yours." one particular burning well that resists all efforts to extinguish it becomes known as "wyatt's torch". later dagny meets him in galt's gulch.

[[paul broca]] in paris was in the process of breaking away from the  [[soci&#xe9;t&#xe9; de biologie]] to form the first of the explicitly anthropological societies, the [[society of anthropology of paris|soci&#xe9;t&#xe9; d'anthropologie de paris]], meeting for the first time in paris in 1859.&lt;ref name=fletcher&gt;{{cite book | first=robert | last=fletcher | chapter=paul broca and the french school of anthropology | title=the saturday lectures, delivered in the lecture-room of the u. s. national museum under the auspices of the anthropological and biological societies of washington in march and april 1882 | year=1882 | location=boston;

his definition now became "the study of the human group, considered as a whole, in its details, and in relation to the rest of nature".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|schiller|1979|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;  broca, being what today would be called a [[neurosurgery|neurosurgeon]], had taken an interest in the pathology of speech. he wanted to localize the difference between man and the other animals, which appeared to reside in speech. he discovered the speech center of the human brain, today called [[broca's area]] after him. his interest was mainly in [[biological anthropology]], but a german philosopher specializing in psychology, [[theodor waitz]], took up the theme of general and social anthropology in his six-volume work, entitled ''die anthropologie der naturv&#xf6;lker'', 1859&#x2013;1864. the title was soon translated as "the anthropology of primitive peoples".  the last two volumes were published posthumously.  waitz defined anthropology as "the science of the nature of man". by nature he meant matter animated by "the divine breath";&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|waitz|1863|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e., he was an [[animism|animist]]. following broca's lead, waitz points out that anthropology is a new field, which would gather material from other fields, but would differ from them in the use of comparative anatomy, physiology, and psychology to differentiate man from "the animals nearest to him". he stresses that the data of comparison must be empirical, gathered by experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|waitz|1863|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; the history of civilization as well as ethnology are to be brought into the comparison. it is to be presumed fundamentally that the species, man, is a unity, and that "the same laws of thought are applicable to all men".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|waitz|1863|pp=11&#x2013;12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  waitz was influential among the british ethnologists. in 1863 the explorer [[richard francis burton]] and the speech therapist [[james hunt (speech therapist)|james hunt]] broke away from the [[ethnological society of london]] to form the [[anthropological society of london]], which henceforward would follow the path of the new anthropology rather than just ethnology. it was the 2nd society dedicated to general anthropology in existence. representatives from the french ''soci&#xe9;t&#xe9;'' were present, though not broca. in his keynote address, printed in the first volume of its new publication, ''the anthropological review'', hunt stressed the work of waitz, adopting his definitions as a standard.&lt;ref name=hunt&gt;{{harvnb|hunt|1863|loc=introductory address}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|hunt's choice of theorists does not exclude the numerous other theorists that were beginning to publish a large volume of anthropological studies.&lt;ref name=hunt/&gt;}} among the first associates were the young [[edward burnett tylor]], inventor of [[cultural anthropology]], and his brother [[alfred tylor]], a geologist. previously edward had referred to himself as an ethnologist; subsequently, an anthropologist.  similar organizations in other countries followed: the anthropological society of madrid (1865), the [[american anthropological association]] in 1902, the anthropological society of vienna (1870), the italian society of anthropology and ethnology (1871), and many others subsequently. the majority of these were evolutionist. one notable exception was the [[berliner gesellschaft f&#xfc;r anthropologie, ethnologie und urgeschichte|berlin society for anthropology, ethnology, and prehistory]] (1869) founded by [[rudolph virchow]], known for his vituperative attacks on the evolutionists. not religious himself, he insisted that darwin's conclusions lacked empirical foundation.  during the last three decades of the 19th century a proliferation of anthropological societies and associations occurred, most independent, most publishing their own journals, and all international in membership and association.  the major theorists belonged to these organizations. they supported the gradual osmosis of anthropology curricula into the major institutions of higher learning. by 1898 the american association for the advancement of science was able to report that 48 educational institutions in 13 countries had some curriculum in anthropology. none of the 75 faculty members were under a department named anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |  title=extent of instruction in anthropology in europe and the united states | first=george grant | last=maccurdy | journal=proceedings of the american association for the advancement of science | year=1899 | pages=382&#x2013;390 | url={{google books|pa385&amp;dq|plainurl=yes}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ===20th and 21st centuries=== this meagre statistic expanded in the 20th century to comprise anthropology departments in the majority of the world's higher educational institutions, many thousands in number. anthropology has diversified from a few major subdivisions to dozens more. practical anthropology, the use of anthropological knowledge and technique to solve specific problems, has arrived; for example, the presence of buried victims might stimulate the use of a forensic archaeologist to recreate the final scene. organization has reached global level. for example, the world council of anthropological associations (wcaa), "a network of national, regional and international associations that aims to promote worldwide communication and cooperation in anthropology", currently contains members from about three dozen nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=home | publisher=world council of anthropological associations | accessdate=29 march 2015 | url= http://www.wcaanet.org/index.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;  since the work of [[franz boas]] and [[bronis&#x142;aw malinowski]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, ''social'' anthropology in great britain and [[cultural anthropology|''cultural'' anthropology]] in the us have been distinguished from other social sciences by its emphasis on [[cross-cultural studies|cross-cultural comparisons]], long-term in-depth examination of context, and the importance it places on [[participant observation|participant-observation]] or experiential immersion in the area of research. cultural anthropology in particular has emphasized [[cultural relativism]], [[holism]], and the use of findings to frame cultural critiques.&lt;ref name="hylland eriksen 2004 p. 79"&gt;hylland eriksen, thomas.

(1981) ''the anthropology of art''.&lt;/ref&gt; to surmount this difficulty, anthropologists of art have focused on formal features in objects which, without exclusively being 'artistic', have certain evident 'aesthetic' qualities. boas' ''primitive art'', claude l&#xe9;vi-strauss' ''the way of the masks'' (1982) or geertz's 'art as cultural system' (1983) are some examples in this trend to transform the anthropology of 'art' into an anthropology of culturally specific 'aesthetics'.  ==== media ==== {{main article|media anthropology}} [[file:punu mask gabon.jpg|thumb|upright|left|a punu tribe mask. gabon central africa]] media anthropology (also known as anthropology of media or mass media) emphasizes [[ethnography|ethnographic studies]] as a means of understanding producers, audiences, and other cultural and social aspects of mass media. the types of ethnographic contexts explored range from contexts of media production (e.g., ethnographies of newsrooms in newspapers, journalists in the field, film production) to contexts of media reception, following audiences in their everyday responses to media.  other types include [[cyber anthropology]], a relatively new area of [[internet research]], as well as ethnographies of other areas of research which happen to involve media, such as development work, [[social movement]]s, or health education. this is in addition to many classic ethnographic contexts, where media such as radio, [[newspaper|the press]], [[new media]] and television have started to make their presences felt since the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=spitulnik, deborah |title=anthropology and mass media|journal=annual review of anthropology|volume=22|page=293|doi=10.1146/annurev.an.22.100193.001453|url=http://www.philbu.net/media-anthropology/spitulnik_mediaanthro.pdf|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=abu-lughod, lila |year=1997|title=the interpretation of cultures after television|journal=representations|volume= 59|pages= 109&#x2013;133|url=https://direitosehumanos.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/a-interpretac3a7c3a3o-das-culturas-depois-da-televisc3a3o.pdf|jstor=2928817}}&lt;/ref&gt;

economic anthropologists have abandoned the primitivist niche they were relegated to by economists, and have now turned to examine corporations, banks, and the [[global financial system]] from an anthropological perspective.  ====political economy==== {{main article|political economy in anthropology}} political economy in anthropology is the application of the theories and methods of [[historical materialism]] to the traditional concerns of anthropology, including, but not limited to, non-capitalist societies. political economy introduced questions of history and colonialism to ahistorical anthropological theories of social structure and culture. three main areas of interest rapidly developed. the first of these areas was concerned with the "pre-capitalist" societies that were subject to evolutionary "tribal" stereotypes. sahlins work on hunter-gatherers as the 'original affluent society' did much to dissipate that image. the second area was concerned with the vast majority of the world's population at the time, the peasantry, many of whom were involved in complex revolutionary wars such as in vietnam. the third area was on colonialism, imperialism, and the creation of the capitalist world-system.&lt;ref name="roseberry 1988 161&#x2013;85"&gt;{{cite journal|last=roseberry|first=william|title=political economy|journal=annual review of anthropology|year=1988|volume=17|pages=161&#x2013;85|doi=10.1146/annurev.an.17.100188.001113}}&lt;/ref&gt; more recently, these political economists have more directly addressed issues of industrial (and post-industrial) capitalism around the world.  ==== applied ==== {{main article|applied anthropology}} applied anthropology refers to the application of the method and theory of anthropology to the analysis and solution of practical problems. it is a, "complex of related, research-based, instrumental methods which produce change or stability in specific cultural systems through the provision of data, initiation of direct action, and/or the formulation of policy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=kedia, satish|first=and willigen j. van|title=applied anthropology: domains of application|isbn=0275978419|year=2005|publisher=praeger|location=westport, conn|pages=16, 150}}&lt;/ref&gt; more simply, applied anthropology is the practical side of anthropological research; it includes researcher involvement and activism within the participating community. it is closely related to [[development anthropology]] (distinct from the more critical [[anthropology of development]]).  ====development==== {{main article|anthropology of development}} anthropology of development  tends to view development from a ''critical'' perspective. the kind of issues addressed and implications for the approach simply involve pondering why, if a key development goal is to alleviate poverty, is poverty increasing? why is there such a gap between plans and outcomes? why are those working in development so willing to disregard history and the lessons it might offer? why is development so externally driven rather than having an internal basis? in short why does so much planned development fail?  ===kinship, feminism, gender and sexuality=== {{anthropology of kinship}}  ==== kinship ==== {{main article|kinship}} ''kinship'' can refer both to ''the study of'' the patterns of social relationships in one or more human cultures, or it can refer to ''the patterns of social relationships'' themselves. over its history, anthropology has developed a number of related concepts and terms, such as "[[kinship|descent]]", "[[descent group]]s", "[[lineage (anthropology)|lineage]]s", "[[affinity (law)|affine]]s", "[[cognatic kinship|cognates]]", and even "[[fictive kinship]]". broadly, kinship patterns may be considered to include people related both by descent (one's social relations during development), and also relatives by marriage.  ==== feminist ==== {{main article|feminist anthropology}} feminist anthropology is a four field approach to anthropology ([[archaeology|archeological]], [[biological anthropology|biological]], [[cultural anthropology|cultural]], [[linguistic anthropology|linguistic]]) that seeks to reduce male bias in research findings, anthropological hiring practices, and the scholarly production of knowledge. anthropology engages often with feminists from non-western traditions, whose perspectives and experiences can differ from those of white european and american feminists. historically, such 'peripheral' perspectives have sometimes been marginalized and regarded as less valid or important than knowledge from the [[western world]]. feminist anthropologists have claimed that their research helps to correct this systematic bias in mainstream [[feminist theory]]. feminist anthropologists are centrally concerned with the construction of gender across societies. feminist anthropology is inclusive of [http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/2940.html birth anthropology] as a specialization. the first [[african-american]] female [[anthropologist]] and [[caribbeanist]] is said to be [[vera mae green]] who studied ethnic and family relations in the [[caribbean]] as well as the united states, and thereby tried to improve the way black life, experiences, and culture were studied.&lt;ref&gt;cole, johnnetta b.

 other subjects that have become central to medical anthropology worldwide are violence and social suffering (farmer, 1999, 2003; beneduce, 2010) as well as other issues that involve physical and psychological harm and suffering that are not a result of illness. on the other hand, there are fields that intersect with medical anthropology in terms of research methodology and theoretical production, such as ''cultural psychiatry'' and ''transcultural psychiatry'' or ''ethnopsychiatry''.  ==== nutritional ==== {{main article|nutritional anthropology}}  nutritional anthropology is a synthetic concept that deals with the interplay between [[economic systems]], [[nutrition|nutritional status]] and [[food security]], and how changes in the former affect the latter. if economic and environmental changes in a community affect access to food, food security, and dietary health, then this interplay between culture and biology is in turn connected to broader historical and economic trends associated with globalization. nutritional status affects overall health status, work performance potential, and the overall potential for economic development (either in terms of human development or traditional western models) for any given group of people.  ==== psychological ==== {{main article|psychological anthropology}} psychological anthropology is an interdisciplinary subfield of anthropology that studies the interaction of [[cultural anthropology|cultural]] and [[psychology|mental processes]]. this subfield tends to focus on ways in which humans' development and [[enculturation]] within a particular cultural group&#x2014;with its own history, language, practices, and conceptual categories&#x2014;shape processes of human [[cognition]], [[emotion]], [[perception]], [[motivation]], and [[mental health]]. it also examines how the understanding of cognition, emotion, motivation, and similar psychological processes inform or constrain our models of cultural and social processes.&lt;ref name="d'andrade"&gt;{{cite book | last=d'andrade | first=r. | chapter=the sad story of anthropology: 1950&#x2013;1999 | editor-first=e. l. | editor-last=cerroni-long | title=anthropological theory in north america |isbn=0897896858| location=westport | publisher=berin &amp;

 ==== cognitive ==== {{main article|cognitive anthropology}} cognitive anthropology seeks to explain patterns of shared knowledge, cultural [[innovation]], and transmission over time and space using the methods and [[theories]] of the [[cognitive sciences]] (especially [[experimental psychology]] and [[evolutionary biology]]) often through close collaboration with historians, ethnographers, archaeologists, linguists, musicologists and other specialists engaged in the description and [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] of cultural forms. cognitive anthropology is concerned with what people from different groups know and how that implicit knowledge changes the way people perceive and relate to the world around them.&lt;ref name="d'andrade"/&gt;  ==== transpersonal ==== {{main article|transpersonal anthropology}} transpersonal anthropology studies the relationship between [[altered states of consciousness]] and culture. as with [[transpersonal psychology]], the field is much concerned with altered states of consciousness (asc) and [[transpersonal experience]]. however, the field differs from mainstream transpersonal psychology in taking more cognizance of cross-cultural issues&#x2014;for instance, the roles of [[mythology|myth]], [[ritual]], [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], and [[literature|texts]] in evoking and interpreting extraordinary experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=young | first1=david e. | first2=j.g. | last2=goulet | date=1994 | title=being changed by cross-cultural encounters: the anthropology of extraordinary experiences | publisher=peterborough: broadview press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ===political and legal=== {{political anthropology}}  ==== political ==== {{main article|political anthropology}} political anthropology concerns the structure of [[form of government|political systems]], looked at from the basis of the structure of societies. political anthropology developed as a discipline concerned primarily with politics in stateless societies, a new development started from the 1960s, and is still unfolding: anthropologists started increasingly to study more "complex" social settings in which the presence of states, bureaucracies and markets entered both ethnographic accounts and analysis of local phenomena. the turn towards complex societies meant that political themes  were taken up at two main levels. first of all, anthropologists continued to study [[political organization]] and political phenomena that lay outside the state-regulated sphere (as in patron-client relations or tribal political organization). second of all, anthropologists slowly started to develop a disciplinary concern with states and their institutions (and of course on the relationship between formal and informal political institutions). an anthropology of the state developed, and it is a most thriving field today. geertz' comparative work on "negara", the balinese state is an early, famous example.  ====legal==== {{main article|legal anthropology}} legal anthropology or anthropology of law specializes in "the cross-cultural study of social ordering".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = greenhouse, carol j. | title = praying for justice: faith, order, and community in an american town |isbn=0801419719| location = ithaca | publisher = cornell up | year = 1986 | page = 28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  earlier legal anthropological research often focused more narrowly on conflict management, crime, sanctions, or formal regulation. more  recent applications include issues such as [[human rights]], [[legal pluralism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=political theologies: public religions in a post-secular world|year=2006|publisher=fordham university press|location=new york|editor1=hent de vries |editor2=lawrence e. sullivan }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and political uprisings.  ====public==== {{main article|public anthropology}} public anthropology was created by robert borofsky, a professor at hawaii pacific university, to "demonstrate the ability of anthropology and anthropologists to effectively address problems beyond the discipline &#x2013; illuminating larger social issues of our times as well as encouraging broad, public conversations about them with the explicit goal of fostering social change" ([http://www.publicanthropology.org borofsky 2004]).  === nature, science and technology=== {{cyber anthropology}}  ====cyborg==== {{main article|cyborg anthropology}} cyborg anthropology originated as a sub-focus group within the [[american anthropological association]]'s annual meeting in 1993. the sub-group was very closely related to [[science and technology studies|sts]] and the [[society for the social studies of science]].&lt;ref&gt;dumit, joseph. davis-floyd, robbie (2001).

all characteristic factors of the hts concept and its application &#x2013; it can no longer be considered a legitimate professional exercise of anthropology. in summary, while we stress that constructive engagement between anthropology and the military is possible, ceaussic suggests that the aaa emphasize the incompatibility of hts with disciplinary ethics and practice for job seekers and that it further recognize the problem of allowing hts to define the meaning of "anthropology" within dod."&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.aaanet.org/2009/12/08/aaa-commission-releases-final-report-on-army-human-terrain-system/ "aaa commission releases final report on army human terrain system"]. american anthropological association (2009-12-08)&lt;/ref&gt;  ==post&#x2013;world war ii developments== before wwii british 'social anthropology' and american 'cultural anthropology' were still distinct traditions. after the war, enough british and american anthropologists borrowed ideas and methodological approaches from one another that some began to speak of them collectively as 'sociocultural' anthropology.  ===basic trends=== there are several characteristics that tend to unite anthropological work. one of the central characteristics is that anthropology tends to provide a comparatively more [[holism|holistic]] account of phenomena and tends to be highly empirical.&lt;ref name="hylland eriksen 2004 p. 79"/&gt; the quest for holism leads most anthropologists to study a particular place, problem or phenomenon in detail, using a variety of methods, over a more extensive period than normal in many parts of academia.  in the 1990s and 2000s (decade), calls for clarification of what constitutes a culture, of how an observer knows where his or her own culture ends and another begins, and other crucial topics in writing anthropology were heard. these dynamic relationships, between what can be observed on the ground, as opposed to what can be observed by compiling many local observations remain fundamental in any kind of anthropology, whether cultural, biological, linguistic or archaeological.&lt;ref&gt;rosaldo, renato (1993).

{{use dmy dates|date=june 2013}} {{agriculture}} &lt;onlyinclude&gt; '''agricultural science''' is a broad multidisciplinary field of [[biology]] that encompasses the parts of exact, natural, economic and [[social science]]s that are used in the practice and understanding of [[agriculture]]. ([[veterinary medicine|veterinary science]], but not [[animal science]], is often excluded from the definition.)&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;  ==agriculture, agricultural science, and agronomy==  the three terms are often confused. however, they cover different concepts: *agriculture is the set of activities that transform the environment for the production of animals and plants for human use. agriculture concerns techniques, including the application of agronomic research. *[[agronomy]] is [[research and development]] related to studying and improving plant-based crops. agricultural sciences include research and development on: * plant breeding and genetics * plant pathology * horticulture * soil science * entmology * production techniques (e.g., [[irrigation]] management, recommended [[nitrogen]] inputs) * improving [[agricultural productivity]] in terms of quantity and quality (e.g., selection of [[drought]]-resistant crops and animals, development of new [[pesticide]]s, yield-sensing technologies, simulation models of crop growth, in-vitro [[cell culture]] techniques) * minimizing the effects of pests ([[weed]]s, [[insect]]s, [[pathogen]]s, [[nematode]]s) on crop or animal production systems. * transformation of primary products into end-consumer products (e.g., production, preservation, and packaging of [[dairy product]]s) * prevention and correction of adverse environmental effects (e.g., [[soil retrogression and degradation|soil degradation]], [[waste management]], [[bioremediation]]) * [[theoretical production ecology]], relating to crop production modeling * traditional agricultural systems, sometimes termed [[subsistence agriculture]], which feed most of the poorest people in the world.  these systems are of interest as they sometimes retain a level of integration with natural ecological systems greater than that of [[industrial agriculture]], which may be more sustainable than some modern agricultural systems. * food production and demand on a global basis, with special attention paid to the major producers, such as china, india, brazil, the usa and the eu. * various sciences relating to agricultural resources and the environment (e.g. soil science, agroclimatology); biology of agricultural crops and animals (e.g. crop science, animal science and their included sciences, e.g. ruminant nutrition, farm animal welfare); such fields as agricultural economics and rural sociology; various disciplines encompassed in agricultural engineering.  ===agricultural biotechnology=== [[agricultural biotechnology]] is a specific area of agricultural science involving the use of scientific tools and techniques, including [[genetic engineering]], [[molecular marker]]s, [[molecular diagnostics]], [[vaccine]]s, and [[tissue culture]], to modify living organisms: plants, animals, and [[microorganism]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://absp2.cornell.edu/resources/briefs/documents/warp_briefs_eng_scr.pdf | title=what is agricultural biotechnology? | publisher=cornell university | accessdate=3 february 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  == fertilizer == one of the most common yield reducers is because of fertilizer not being applied in slightly higher quantities during transition period, the time it takes the soil to rebuild its aggregates and organic matter.  yields will decrease temporarily because of nitrogen being immobilized in the crop residue, which can take a few months to several years to decompose, depending on the crop's c to n ratio and the local environment  ==a local science== {{unreferenced section|date=july 2015}} with the exception of [[theoretical production ecology|theoretical agronomy]], research in agronomy, more than in any other field, is strongly related to local areas. it can be considered a science of [[ecoregion]]s, because it is closely linked to soil properties and [[climate]], which are never exactly the same from one place to another. many people think an agricultural production system relying on local weather, [[soil]] characteristics, and specific crops has to be studied locally. others feel a need to know and understand production systems in as many areas as possible, and the human dimension of interaction with nature.  ==history of agricultural science== {{main article|history of agricultural science}}  agricultural science began with [[gregor mendel]]'s genetic work, but in modern terms might be better dated from the [[chemical fertilizer]] outputs of [[plant physiology|plant physiological]] understanding in 18th-century germany.{{citation needed|date=december 2007}} in the united states, a scientific revolution in agriculture began with the [[hatch act of 1887]], which used the term "agricultural science". the hatch act was driven by farmers' interest in knowing the constituents of early artificial fertilizer. the [[smith-hughes act]] of 1917 shifted agricultural education back to its vocational roots, but the scientific foundation had been built.&lt;ref&gt;hillison j.

[[blackwell publishing]].&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|xxi}}  intensification of agriculture since the 1960s in developed and [[developing country|developing countries]], often referred to as the [[green revolution]], was closely tied to progress made in selecting and improving crops and animals for high productivity, as well as to developing additional inputs such as artificial [[fertilizer]]s and [[pesticide|phytosanitary product]]s.  as the oldest and largest human intervention in nature, the environmental impact of agriculture in general and more recently [[intensive agriculture]], industrial development, and population growth have raised many questions among agricultural scientists and have led to the development and emergence of new fields. these include technological fields that assume the solution to technological problems lies in better technology, such as [[integrated pest management]], [[waste management|waste treatment]] technologies, [[landscape architecture]], [[genomics]], and [[agricultural philosophy]] fields that include references to [[food industry|food production]] as something essentially different from non-essential economic 'goods'. in fact, the interaction between these two approaches provide a fertile field for deeper understanding in agricultural science.  new technologies, such as [[biotechnology]] and [[computer science]] (for data processing and storage), and technological advances have made it possible to develop new research fields, including [[genetic engineering]], [[agrophysics]], improved [[statistics|statistical analysis]], and [[precision farming]]. balancing these, as above, are the natural and human sciences of agricultural science that seek to understand the human-nature interactions of [[history of agriculture|traditional agriculture]], including interaction of [[religion and agriculture|religion and agriculture]], and the non-material components of agricultural production systems.  ==prominent agricultural scientists== [[file:norman borlaug.jpg|thumb|200px|norman borlaug, father of the [[green revolution]].]] * [[robert bakewell (farmer)|robert bakewell]] * [[norman borlaug]] * [[luther burbank]] * [[george washington carver]] * [[ren&#xe9;

 == history == alchemy covers several philosophical traditions spanning some four millennia and three continents. these traditions' general penchant for cryptic and symbolic language makes it hard to trace their mutual influences and "genetic" relationships. one can distinguish at least three major strands, which appear to be largely independent, at least in their earlier stages: [[chinese alchemy]], centered in china and its zone of cultural influence; [[rasayana|indian alchemy]], centered on the [[indian subcontinent]]; and western alchemy, which occurred around the [[mediterranean basin|mediterranean]] and whose center has shifted over the millennia from [[egypt (roman province)|greco-roman egypt]], to the [[muslim world|islamic world]], and finally [[middle ages|medieval europe]]. chinese alchemy was closely connected to [[taoism]] and indian alchemy with the [[indian religions|dharmic faiths]], whereas western alchemy developed its own philosophical system that was largely independent of, but influenced by, various [[western religion]]s. it is still an open question whether these three strands share a common origin, or to what extent they influenced each other.  === hellenistic egypt === [[file:zosimosapparat.jpg|thumb|left|300px| ambix, cucurbit and retort of [[zosimos of panopolis|zosimos]], from [[marcelin berthelot]], ''collection des anciens alchimistes grecs'' (3 vol., paris, 1887&#x2013;1888).]]  the start of western alchemy may generally be traced to ancient and [[hellenistic egypt]], where the city of [[alexandria]] was a center of alchemical knowledge, and retained its pre-eminence through most of the greek and roman periods.&lt;ref&gt;''new scientist'', 24&#x2013;31 december 1987&lt;/ref&gt; here, elements of technology, religion, mythology, and [[hellenistic philosophy]], each with their own much longer histories, combined to form the earliest known records of alchemy in the west. [[zosimos of panopolis]] wrote the oldest known books on alchemy,{{citation needed|date=february 2013}} while [[mary the jewess]] is credited as being the first non-fictitious western alchemist. they wrote in [[greek language|greek]] and lived in [[egypt]] under [[roman empire|roman]] rule.  '''mythology''' &#x2013; zosimos of panopolis asserted that alchemy dated back to [[ancient egypt|pharaonic egypt]] where it was the domain of the priestly class, though there is little to no evidence for his assertion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=garfinkel|first=harold|title=ethnomethodological studies of work|publisher=routledge &amp;kegan paul|year=1986|pages=127|isbn=0-415-11965-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; alchemical writers used classical figures from greek, roman, and egyptian mythology to illuminate their works and allegorize alchemical transmutation.&lt;ref&gt;yves bonnefoy. 'roman and european mythologies'. university of chicago press, 1992. pp. 211&#x2013;213&lt;/ref&gt;  these included the pantheon of gods related to the classical planets, [[isis]], [[osiris]], [[jason]], and many others.  the central figure in the mythology of alchemy is [[hermes trismegistus]] (or thrice-great hermes). his name is derived from the [[deity|god]] [[thoth]] and his greek counterpart [[hermes]]. hermes and his [[caduceus]] or serpent-staff, were among alchemy's principal symbols. according to [[clement of alexandria]], he wrote what were called the "forty-two books of hermes", covering all fields of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:ante-nicene fathers/volume ii/clement of alexandria/the stromata, or miscellanies/book vi/chapter iv.|clement, ''stromata'', vi. 4.]]&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[hermetica]]'' of thrice-great hermes is generally understood to form the basis for western alchemical philosophy and practice, called the [[hermeticism|hermetic philosophy]] by its early practitioners. these writings were collected in the first centuries of the common era.

[[lactantius]] believed hermes trismegistus had prophesied its birth.

according to jabir, in each metal two of these qualities were interior and two were exterior. for example, lead was externally cold and dry, while gold was hot and moist. thus, jabir theorized, by rearranging the qualities of one metal, a different metal would result.&lt;ref name=burckhardt29&gt;{{cite book | first=titus | last=burckhardt | authorlink=titus burckhardt | title=alchemy: science of the cosmos, science of the soul | location=baltimore | publisher=penguin | year=1967 | page=29 | others=trans. william stoddart | isbn=0-906540-96-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; by this reasoning, the search for the [[philosopher's stone]] was introduced to western alchemy. jabir developed an elaborate [[numerology]] whereby the root letters of a substance's name in arabic, when treated with various transformations, held correspondences to the element's physical properties.  the elemental system used in medieval alchemy also originated with jabir. his original system consisted of seven elements, which included the five [[classical element]]s ([[aether (classical element)|aether]], [[air (classical element)|air]], [[earth (classical element)|earth]], [[fire (classical element)|fire]], and [[water (classical element)|water]]) in addition to two [[chemical element]]s representing the metals: [[sulfur|sulphur]], "the stone which burns", which characterized the principle of combustibility, and [[mercury (element)|mercury]], which contained the idealized principle of metallic properties. shortly thereafter, this evolved into eight elements, with the arabic concept of the three metallic principles: sulphur giving flammability or combustion, mercury giving volatility and stability, and [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] giving solidity.&lt;ref name="r8"&gt;strathern, paul.

"roger bacon's place in the history of alchemy." ''ambix.'' vol. 23, part i, march 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; like the greeks before him, bacon acknowledged the division of alchemy into practical and theoretical spheres. he noted that the theoretical lay outside the scope of aristotle, the natural philosophers, and all latin writers of his time. the practical, however, confirmed the theoretical thought experiment, and bacon advocated its uses in natural science and medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|holmyard|1957|pp=120&#x2013;121}}&lt;/ref&gt; in later european legend, however, bacon became an archmage. in particular, along with albertus magnus, he was credited with the forging of a [[brazen head]] capable of answering its owner's questions.  soon after bacon, the influential work of [[pseudo-geber]] (sometimes identified as [[paul of taranto]]) appeared. his ''summa perfectionis'' remained a staple summary of alchemical practice and theory through the medieval and renaissance periods. it was notable for its inclusion of practical chemical operations alongside sulphur-mercury theory, and the unusual clarity with which they were described.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|holmyard|1957|pp=134&#x2013;141}}.&lt;/ref&gt; by the end of the 13th century, alchemy had developed into a fairly structured system of belief. adepts believed in the macrocosm-microcosm theories of hermes, that is to say, they believed that processes that affect minerals and other substances could have an effect on the human body (for example, if one could learn the secret of purifying gold, one could use the technique to purify the [[soul|human soul]]). they believed in the four elements and the four qualities as described above, and they had a strong tradition of cloaking their written ideas in a labyrinth of coded [[jargon]] set with traps to mislead the uninitiated. finally, the alchemists practiced their art: they actively experimented with chemicals and made [[observation]]s and [[theory|theories]] about how the universe operated. their entire philosophy revolved around their belief that man's soul was divided within himself after the fall of adam. by purifying the two parts of man's soul, man could be reunited with god.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=titus | last=burckhardt | authorlink=titus burckhardt | title=alchemy: science of the cosmos, science of the soul | location=baltimore | publisher=penguin | year=1967 | page=149 | others=trans. william stoddart | isbn=0-906540-96-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in the 14th century, alchemy became more accessible to europeans outside the confines of latin speaking churchmen and scholars. alchemical discourse shifted from scholarly philosophical debate to an exposed social commentary on the alchemists themselves.&lt;ref&gt;tara e. nummedal.

''alchemy and authority in the holy roman empire.'' p.171&lt;/ref&gt;  false alchemists were sometimes prosecuted for fraud.  the terms "chemia" and "alchemia" were used as synonyms in the early modern period, and the differences between alchemy, chemistry and small-scale assaying and metallurgy were not as neat as in the present day. there were important overlaps between practitioners, and trying to classify them into alchemists, chemists and craftsmen is anachronistic. for example, [[tycho brahe]] (1546&#x2013;1601), an alchemist better known for his [[astronomical]] and [[astrological]] investigations, had a laboratory built at his [[uraniborg]] observatory/research institute. [[micha&#x142; s&#x119;dziw&#xf3;j|michael sendivogius]] (''micha&#x142; s&#x119;dziw&#xf3;j'', 1566&#x2013;1636), a [[poland|polish]] alchemist, philosopher, medical doctor and pioneer of chemistry wrote mystical works but is also credited with distilling [[oxygen]] in a lab sometime around 1600. sendivogious taught his technique to [[cornelius drebbel]] who, in 1621, applied this in a submarine. [[isaac newton]] devoted considerably more of his writing to the study of alchemy (see [[isaac newton's occult studies]]) than he did to either optics or physics. other early modern alchemists who were eminent in their other studies include [[robert boyle]], and [[jan baptist van helmont]]. their hermeticism complemented rather than precluded their practical achievements in medicine and science.  === late modern period === [[file:the shannon portrait of the hon robert boyle.jpg|thumb|right|robert boyle]] the decline of european alchemy was brought about by the rise of modern science with its emphasis on rigorous quantitative experimentation and its disdain for "ancient wisdom". although the seeds of these events were planted as early as the 17th century, alchemy still flourished for some two hundred years, and in fact may have reached its [[apogee]] in the 18th century. as late as 1781 [[james price (chemist)|james price]] claimed to have produced a powder that could transmute mercury into silver or gold. early modern european alchemy continued to exhibit a diversity of theories, practices, and purposes: "scholastic and anti-aristotelian, paracelsian and anti-paracelsian, hermetic, neoplatonic, mechanistic, vitalistic, and more&#x2014;plus virtually every combination and compromise thereof."&lt;ref name="alchemy restored"&gt;principe, lawrence m.

either in [[observational astronomy]], in analyzing the data or in [[theoretical astronomy]]. examples of topics or fields astronomers work on include: [[planetary science]], solar astronomy, the origin or [[stellar evolution|evolution of stars]], or the [[galaxy formation and evolution|formation of galaxies]]. there are also related but distinct subjects like [[physical cosmology]] which studies the [[universe]] as a whole.  astronomers usually fit into two types: observational and theoretical. observational astronomers make direct observations of planets, stars and galaxies, and analyze the data. in contrast, theoretical astronomers create and investigate models of things that cannot be observed. because it takes millions to billions of years for a system of stars or a galaxy to complete a life cycle, astronomers have to observe snapshots of different systems at unique points in their evolution to determine how they form, evolve and die. they use this data to create models or simulations to theorize how different celestial bodies work.  there are further subcategories inside these two main branches of astronomy such as planetary astronomy, [[galactic astronomy]] or physical cosmology.  == academic == {{for|subdisciplines|outline of astronomy}} [[image:galileo.arp.300pix.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[galileo]] is often referred to as the father of [[modern astronomy]]]] &lt;!-- [[wp:nfcc]] violation: [[file:sagan planetary orbits2.jpg|right|thumb|[[carl sagan]] on the set of ''[[cosmos]]'']] --&gt;

 the committee debated the possibility of a [[shift code|shift]] function (like in [[ita2]]), which would allow more than 64 codes to be represented by a [[six-bit character code|six-bit code]]. in a shifted code, some character codes determine choices between options for the following character codes. it allows compact encoding, but is less reliable for [[data transmission]], as an error in transmitting the shift code typically makes a long part of the transmission unreadable. the standards committee decided against shifting, and so ascii required at least a seven-bit code.&lt;ref name="mackenzie_1980"/&gt;{{rp|215, 236&amp;thinsp;&#xa7;&amp;thinsp;4}}  the committee considered an eight-bit code, since eight bits ([[octet (computing)|octet]]s) would allow two four-bit patterns to efficiently encode two digits with [[binary-coded decimal]]. however, it would require all data transmission to send eight bits when seven could suffice. the committee voted to use a seven-bit code to minimize costs associated with data transmission. since perforated tape at the time could record eight bits in one position, it also allowed for a [[parity bit]] for [[error checking]] if desired.&lt;ref name="mackenzie_1980"/&gt;{{rp|217, 236&amp;thinsp;&#xa7;&amp;thinsp;5}} [[eight-bit]] machines (with octets as the native data type) that did not use parity checking typically set the eighth bit to 0.&lt;ref name="sawyer_1995"&gt;{{cite book |author-first1=stanley a. |author-last1=sawyer |author-first2=steven george |author-last2=krantz |title=a tex primer for scientists |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bxldwmijnkuc&amp;pg=pa13 |year=1995 |publisher=[[crc press, llc]] |isbn=978-0-8493-7159-2 |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; in some printers, the high bit was used to enable [[italics]] printing.  ===internal organization=== the code itself was patterned so that most control codes were together and all graphic codes were together, for ease of identification. the first two so called ''ascii sticks''{{efn|name="nb_stick"}}&lt;ref name="bemer_1980_inside"/&gt; (32 positions) were reserved for control characters.&lt;ref name="mackenzie_1980"/&gt;{{rp|220, 236&amp;thinsp;&#xa7;&amp;thinsp;8,9)}} the [[space (punctuation)|"space" character]] had to come before graphics to make [[sorting algorithm|sorting]] easier, so it became position 20&lt;sub&gt;[[hexadecimal|hex]]&lt;/sub&gt;;&lt;ref name="mackenzie_1980"/&gt;{{rp|237&amp;thinsp;&#xa7;&amp;thinsp;10}} for the same reason, many special signs commonly used as separators were placed before digits. the committee decided it was important to support [[upper case|uppercase]] [[sixbit code pages|64-character alphabets]], and chose to pattern ascii so it could be reduced easily to a usable 64-character set of graphic codes,&lt;ref name="mackenzie_1980"/&gt;{{rp|228, 237&amp;thinsp;&#xa7;&amp;thinsp;14}} as was done in the [[dec sixbit]] code (1963). [[lower case|lowercase]] letters were therefore not interleaved with uppercase. to keep options available for lowercase letters and other graphics, the special and numeric codes were arranged before the letters, and the letter ''a'' was placed in position 41&lt;sub&gt;[[hexadecimal|hex]]&lt;/sub&gt; to match the draft of the corresponding british standard.&lt;ref name="mackenzie_1980"/&gt;{{rp|238&amp;thinsp;&#xa7;&amp;thinsp;18}} the digits 0&#x2013;9 are prefixed with 011, but the remaining [[nibble|4 bits]] correspond to their respective values in binary, making conversion with [[binary-coded decimal]] straightforward.  many of the non-alphanumeric characters were positioned to correspond to their shifted position on typewriters; an important subtlety is that these were based on ''mechanical'' typewriters, not ''electric'' typewriters.&lt;ref name="savard"&gt;{{cite web |title=computer keyboards |url=http://www.quadibloc.com/comp/kybint.htm |author-first=john j. g. |author-last=savard |access-date=2014-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; mechanical typewriters followed the standard set by the remington no. 2 (1878), the first typewriter with a shift key, and the shifted values of &lt;code&gt;23456789-&lt;/code&gt; were &lt;code&gt;"#$%_&amp;'()&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;&#x2014; early typewriters omitted ''0'' and ''1'', using ''o'' (capital letter ''o'') and ''l'' (lowercase letter ''l'') instead, but &lt;code&gt;1!&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;0)&lt;/code&gt; pairs became standard once 0 and 1 became common. thus, in ascii &lt;code&gt;!"#$%&lt;/code&gt; were placed in the second stick,{{efn|name="nb_stick"}}&lt;ref name="bemer_1980_inside"/&gt; positions 1&#x2013;5, corresponding to the digits 1&#x2013;5 in the adjacent stick.{{efn|name="nb_stick"}}&lt;ref name="bemer_1980_inside"/&gt; the parentheses could not correspond to ''9'' and ''0'', however, because the place corresponding to ''0'' was taken by the space character. this was accommodated by removing &lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt; (underscore) from ''6'' and shifting the remaining characters, which corresponded to many european typewriters that placed the parentheses with ''8'' and ''9''. this discrepancy from typewriters led to [[bit-paired keyboard]]s, notably the [[teletype model 33]], which used the left-shifted layout corresponding to ascii, not to traditional mechanical typewriters. electric typewriters, notably the [[ibm selectric]] (1961), used a somewhat different layout that has become standard on computers&amp;nbsp;&#x2014; following the [[ibm pc]] (1981), especially [[model m]] (1984)&amp;nbsp;&#x2014; and thus shift values for symbols on modern keyboards do not correspond as closely to the ascii table as earlier keyboards did. the &lt;code&gt;/?&lt;/code&gt; pair also dates to the no. 2, and the &lt;code&gt;,&amp;lt; .&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; pairs were used on some keyboards (others, including the no. 2, did not shift &lt;code&gt;,&lt;/code&gt; (comma) or &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; (full stop) so they could be used in uppercase without unshifting). however, ascii split the &lt;code&gt;;:&lt;/code&gt; pair (dating to no. 2), and rearranged mathematical symbols (varied conventions, commonly &lt;code&gt;-* =+&lt;/code&gt;) to &lt;code&gt;:* ;+ -=&lt;/code&gt;.  some common characters were not included, notably &lt;code&gt;&#xbd;&#xbc;&#xa2;&lt;/code&gt;, while &lt;code&gt;^`~&lt;/code&gt; were included as diacritics for international use, and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; for mathematical use, together with the simple line characters &lt;code&gt;\|&lt;/code&gt; (in addition to common &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;). the ''@'' symbol was not used in continental europe and the committee expected it would be replaced by an accented ''&#xc0;'' in the french variation, so the ''@'' was placed in position 40&lt;sub&gt;[[hexadecimal|hex]]&lt;/sub&gt;, right before the letter a.&lt;ref name="mackenzie_1980"/&gt;{{rp|243}}  the control codes felt essential for data transmission were the start of message (som), end of address (eoa), [[end of message|end of message]] (eom), end of transmission (eot), "who are you?" (wru), "are you?" (ru), a reserved device control (dc0), synchronous idle (sync), and acknowledge (ack). these were positioned to maximize the [[hamming distance]] between their bit patterns.&lt;ref name="mackenzie_1980"/&gt;{{rp|243&#x2013;245}}  ===character order=== ascii-code order is also called ''asciibetical'' order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,2542,t=asciibetical&amp;i=38025,00.asp |title=asciibetical definition |magazine=[[pc magazine]] |access-date=2008-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[collation]] of data is sometimes done in this order rather than "standard" alphabetical order ([[collating sequence]]). the main deviations in ascii order are: * all uppercase come before lowercase letters; for example, "z" precedes "a" * digits and many punctuation marks come before letters * numbers are sorted na&#xef;vely as strings; for example, "10" precedes "2"  an intermediate order&amp;nbsp;&#x2014; readily implemented&amp;nbsp;&#x2014; converts uppercase letters to lowercase before comparing ascii values. na&#xef;ve number sorting can be averted by [[leading zero|zero-filling]] all numbers (e.g. "02" will sort before "10" as expected), although this is an external fix and has nothing to do with the ordering itself.  ==character groups==  ==={{anchor|ascii control characters}}control characters=== {{main|control character}}  ascii reserves the first 32 codes (numbers 0&#x2013;31 decimal) for [[control character]]s: codes originally intended not to represent printable information, but rather to control devices (such as [[computer printer|printers]]) that make use of ascii, or to provide [[metadata|meta-information]] about data streams such as those stored on magnetic tape.  for example, character 10 represents the "line feed" function (which causes a printer to advance its paper), and character 8 represents "backspace". rfc 2822 refers to control characters that do not include carriage return, line feed or [[whitespace (computer science)|white space]] as non-whitespace control characters.&lt;ref name="rfc-2822"&gt;{{citation |title=internet message format |author-first=p. |author-last=resnick |date=april 2001 |rfc=2822 |url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2822 |access-date=2016-06-13 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160613203505/https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2822 |archive-date=2016-06-13}} (nb. no-ws-ctl.)&lt;/ref&gt; except for the control characters that prescribe elementary line-oriented formatting, ascii does not define any mechanism for describing the structure or appearance of text within a document. other schemes, such as [[markup language]]s, address page and document layout and formatting.  the original ascii standard used only short descriptive phrases for each control character. the ambiguity this caused was sometimes intentional, for example where a character would be used slightly differently on a terminal link than on a [[data stream]], and sometimes accidental, for example with the meaning of "delete".  probably the most influential single device on the interpretation of these characters was the [[teletype model 33]] asr, which was a printing terminal with an available [[punched tape|paper tape]] reader/punch option. paper tape was a very popular medium for long-term program storage until the 1980s, less costly and in some ways less fragile than magnetic tape. in particular, the teletype model 33 machine assignments for codes 17 (control-q, dc1, also known as xon), 19 (control-s, dc3, also known as xoff), and 127 ([[delete key|delete]]) became de facto standards. the model 33 was also notable for taking the description of control-g (code 7, bel, meaning audibly alert the operator) literally, as the unit contained an actual bell which it rang when it received a bel character.  because the keytop for the o key also showed a left-arrow symbol (from ascii-1963, which had this character instead of [[underscore]]), a noncompliant use of code 15 (control-o, shift in) interpreted as "delete previous character" was also adopted by many early timesharing systems but eventually became neglected.  when a teletype 33 asr equipped with the automatic paper tape reader received a control-s (xoff, an abbreviation for transmit off), it caused the tape reader to stop; receiving control-q (xon, "transmit on") caused the tape reader to resume.  this technique became adopted by several early computer operating systems as a "handshaking" signal warning a sender to stop transmission because of impending overflow; it persists to this day in many systems as a manual output control technique. on some systems control-s retains its meaning but control-q is replaced by a second control-s to resume output.  the 33 asr also could be configured to employ control-r (dc2) and control-t (dc4) to start and stop the tape punch; on some units equipped with this function, the corresponding control character lettering on the keycap above the letter was tape and &lt;s&gt;tape&lt;/s&gt; respectively.&lt;ref name="mcconnell"&gt;{{cite web |title=understanding ascii codes |author-last1=mcconnell |author-first1=robert |author-last2=haynes |author-first2=james |author-last3=warren |author-first3=richard |url=http://www.nadcomm.com/ascii_code.htm |access-date=2014-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  code 127 is officially named "delete" but the teletype label was "rubout". since the original standard did not give detailed interpretation for most control codes, interpretations of this code varied. the original teletype meaning, and the intent of the standard, was to make it an ignored character, the same as nul (all zeroes). this was useful specifically for paper tape, because punching the all-ones bit pattern on top of an existing mark would obliterate it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-gnu-emacs/2014-05/msg00448.html |title=re: editor and word processor history (was: re: rtf for emacs)}}&lt;/ref&gt; tapes designed to be "hand edited" could even be produced with spaces of extra nuls (blank tape) so that a block of characters could be "rubbed out" and then replacements put into the empty space.  some software assigned special meanings to ascii characters sent to the software from the terminal. operating systems from [[digital equipment corporation]], for example, interpreted del as an input character as meaning "remove previously-typed input character",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/dec/pdp6/dec-6-0-ex-sys-um-ip-pre00_multiprogramming_system_manual_1965.pdf |title=pdp-6 multiprogramming system manual |page=43 |publisher=[[digital equipment corporation]] (dec) |year=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bitsavers.org/pdf/dec/pdp10/1970_pdp-10_ref/1970pdp10ref_part3.pdf |title=pdp-10 reference handbook, book 3, communicating with the monitor |page=5-5 |publisher=[[digital equipment corporation]] (dec) |year=1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this interpretation also became common in unix systems. most other systems used bs for that meaning and used del to mean "remove the character at the cursor".{{citation needed|date=july 2014}} that latter interpretation is the most common now.{{citation needed|date=july 2014}}  many more of the control codes have been given meanings quite different from their original ones. the "escape" character (esc, code 27), for example, was intended originally to allow sending other control characters as literals instead of invoking their meaning. this is the same meaning of "escape" encountered in url encodings, [[c (programming language)|c language]] strings, and other systems where certain characters have a reserved meaning. over time this meaning has been co-opted and has eventually been changed. in modern use, an esc sent to the terminal usually indicates the start of a command sequence usually in the form of a so-called "[[ansi escape code]]" (or, more properly, a "[[control sequence introducer]]") from ecma-48 (1972) and its successors, beginning with esc followed by a "&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;" (left-bracket) character. an esc sent from the terminal is most often used as an [[out-of-band data|out-of-band]] character used to terminate an operation, as in the [[text editor and corrector|teco]] and [[vi]] [[text editor]]s. in [[graphical user interface]] (gui) and [[window (computing)|windowing]] systems, esc generally causes an application to abort its current operation or to [[exit (operating system)|exit]] (terminate) altogether.  the inherent ambiguity of many control characters, combined with their historical usage, created problems when transferring "plain text" files between systems. the best example of this is the [[newline]] problem on various [[operating system]]s. teletype machines required that a line of text be terminated with both "carriage return" (which moves the printhead to the beginning of the line) and "line feed" (which advances the paper one line without moving the printhead). the name "carriage return" comes from the fact that on a manual [[typewriter]] the carriage holding the paper moved while the position where the typebars struck the ribbon remained stationary.  the entire carriage had to be pushed (returned) to the right in order to position the left margin of the paper for the next line.  [[digital equipment corporation|dec]] operating systems ([[os/8]], [[rt-11]], [[rsx-11]], [[rsts/e|rsts]], [[tops-10]], etc.) used both characters to mark the end of a line so that the console device (originally [[teleprinter|teletype machines]]) would work. by the time so-called "glass ttys" (later called crts or terminals) came along, the convention was so well established that backward compatibility necessitated continuing the convention. when [[gary kildall]] created [[cp/m]] he was inspired by some command line interface conventions used in [[digital equipment corporation|dec]]'s [[rt-11]]. until the introduction of [[pc dos]] in 1981, [[ibm]] had no hand in this because their 1970s operating systems used ebcdic instead of ascii and they were oriented toward punch-card input and line printer output on which the concept of carriage return was meaningless. ibm's [[pc dos]] (also marketed as [[ms-dos]] by microsoft) inherited the convention by virtue of being a clone of [[cp/m]], and [[windows]] inherited it from ms-dos.  unfortunately, requiring two characters to mark the end of a line introduces unnecessary complexity and questions as to how to interpret each character when encountered alone. to simplify matters [[plain text]] data streams, including files, on [[multics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.multicians.org/jhs-jfo-terminals.pdf |title=technical and human engineering problems in connecting terminals to a time-sharing system |author-last1=ossanna |author-first1=j. f. |author-link1=joe ossanna |author-last2=saltzer |author-first2=j. h. |author-link2=jerry saltzer |date=november 17&#x2013;19, 1970 |publisher=[[afips]] press |booktitle=proceedings of the november 17&#x2013;19, 1970, [[fall joint computer conference]] (fjcc) |pages=355&#x2013;362 |location=p. 357 |quote=using a "new-line" function (combined carriage-return and line-feed) is simpler for both man and machine than requiring both functions for starting a new line; the american national standard x3.4-1968 permits the line-feed code to carry the new-line meaning.}}&lt;/ref&gt; used line feed (lf) alone as a line terminator. [[unix]] and [[unix-like]] systems, and [[amiga]] systems, adopted this convention from multics. the original [[macintosh os]], [[apple dos]], and [[prodos]], on the other hand, used carriage return (cr) alone as a line terminator; however, since apple replaced these operating systems with the unix-based [[macos]] operating system, they now use line feed (lf) as well. the radio shack [[trs-80]] also used a lone cr to terminate lines.  computers attached to the [[arpanet]] included machines running operating systems such as tops-10 and [[tops-20#tenex|tenex]] using cr-lf line endings, machines running operating systems such as multics using lf line endings, and machines running operating systems such as [[os/360]] that represented lines as a character count followed by the characters of the line and that used [[ebcdic]] rather than ascii.  the [[telnet]] protocol defined an ascii "[[network virtual terminal]]" (nvt), so that connections between hosts with different line-ending conventions and character sets could be supported by transmitting a standard text format over the network. telnet used ascii along with cr-lf line endings, and software using other conventions would translate between the local conventions and the nvt.&lt;ref name="rfc-158"&gt;{{citation |title=telnet protocol |rfc=158 |pages=4&#x2013;5 |author-first=t. |author-last=o'sullivan |date=1971-05-19 |publisher=[[internet engineering task force]] (ietf) |url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc158 |access-date=2013-01-28 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160613202223/https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc158 |archive-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[file transfer protocol]] adopted the telnet protocol, including use of the network virtual terminal, for use when transmitting commands and transferring data in the default ascii mode.&lt;ref name="rfc-542"&gt;{{citation |title=file transfer protocol |rfc=542 |author-first=nancy j. |author-last=neigus |date=1973-08-12 |publisher=[[internet engineering task force]] (ietf) |url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc542 |access-date=2013-01-28 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160613202314/https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc542 |archive-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rfc-765"&gt;{{citation |title=file transfer protocol |rfc=765 |author-first=jon |author-last=postel |author-link=jon postel |date=june 1980 |publisher=[[internet engineering task force]] (ietf) |url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc765 |access-date=2013-01-28 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160613202356/https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc765 |archive-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; this adds complexity to implementations of those protocols, and to other network protocols, such as those used for e-mail and the world wide web, on systems not using the nvt's cr-lf line-ending convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/eoltranslationplan |title=eol translation plan for mercurial |publisher=mercurial |access-date=2017-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=bare lfs in smtp |url=http://cr.yp.to/docs/smtplf.html |author-first=daniel j. |author-last=bernstein |author-link=daniel j. bernstein |access-date=2013-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  older operating systems such as tops-10, along with cp/m, tracked file length only in units of disk blocks and used control-z (sub) to mark the end of the actual text in the file. for this reason, eof, or [[end-of-file]], was used colloquially and conventionally as a [[three-letter acronym]] for control-z instead of substitute.  the end-of-text code ([[end-of-text character|etx]]), also known as [[control-c]], was inappropriate for a variety of reasons, while using z as the control code to end a file is analogous to it ending the alphabet and serves as a very convenient [[mnemonic device|mnemonic aid]]. a historically common and still prevalent convention uses the etx code convention to interrupt and halt a program via an input data stream, usually from a keyboard.  in c library and [[unix]] conventions, the [[null character]] is used to terminate text [[string (computer science)|strings]]; such [[null-terminated string]]s can be known in abbreviation as asciz or asciiz, where here z stands for "zero".  {{anchor|ascii control code chart}} {| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center" |- !

then type the rubout character. they therefore placed a key producing rubout at the location used on typewriters for backspace. when systems used these terminals and provided command-line editing, they had to use the "rubout" code to perform a backspace, and often did not interpret the backspace character (they might echo "&lt;code&gt;^h&lt;/code&gt;" for backspace). other terminals not

|quote=there was the change from 1961 ascii to 1968 ascii. some computer languages used characters in 1961 ascii such as up arrow and left arrow. these characters disappeared from 1968 ascii. we worked with fred mocking, who by now was in sales at [[teletype corporation|teletype]], on a type cylinder that would compromise the changing characters so that the meanings of 1961 ascii were not totally lost. the underscore character was made rather wedge-shaped so it could also serve as a left arrow. }}&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;!-- to be more useful this list should be expanded to include the

computers and information processing: acceptance of draft iso recommendation no. 1052 |date=1967-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; caused ascii's choices for the national use characters to seem to be de facto standards for the world, causing confusion and incompatibility once other countries did begin to make their own assignments to these code points.  iso/iec 646, like ascii, is a 7-bit character set. it does not make any additional codes available, so the same code points encoded different characters in different countries. escape codes were defined to indicate which national variant applied to a piece of text, but they were rarely used, so it was often impossible to know what variant to work with and, therefore, which character a code represented, and in general, text-processing systems could cope with only one variant anyway.  because the bracket and brace characters of ascii were assigned to "national use" code points that were used for accented letters in other national variants of iso/iec 646, a german, french, or swedish, etc. programmer using their national variant of iso/iec 646, rather than ascii, had to write, and thus read, something such as  :&lt;code&gt;&#xe4; a&#xc4;i&#xdc; = '&#xd6;n'; &#xfc;&lt;/code&gt;  instead of  :&lt;code&gt;{ a[i] = '\n'; }&lt;/code&gt;  [[c trigraph]]s were created to solve this problem for [[ansi c]], although their late introduction and inconsistent implementation in compilers limited their use. many programmers kept their computers on us-ascii, so plain-text in swedish, german etc. (for example, in e-mail or [[usenet]]) contained "{, }" and similar variants in the middle of words, something those programmers got used to. for example, a swedish programmer mailing another programmer asking if they should go for lunch, could get "n{ jag har sm|rg}sar" as the answer, which should be "n&#xe4; jag har sm&#xf6;rg&#xe5;sar" meaning "no i've got sandwiches".  ==={{anchor|8-bit}}8-bit codes=== {{main|extended ascii|iso/iec 8859}}{{see also|utf-8}} &lt;!-- to be mentioned [[usascii-8]] --&gt; eventually, as 8-, [[16-bit|16-]] and [[32-bit]] (and later [[64-bit]]) computers began to replace [[18-bit|18-]] and [[36-bit]] computers as the norm, it became common to use an 8-bit byte to store each character in memory, providing an opportunity for extended, 8-bit, relatives of ascii. in most cases these developed as true extensions of ascii, leaving the original character-mapping intact, but adding additional character definitions after the first 128 (i.e., 7-bit) characters.  encodings include [[iscii]] (india), [[viscii]] (vietnam). although these encodings are sometimes referred to as ascii, true ascii is defined strictly only by the ansi standard.  most early home computer systems developed their own 8-bit character sets containing line-drawing and game glyphs, and often filled in some or all of the control characters from 0 to 31 with more graphics. [[kaypro]] [[cp/m]] computers used the "upper" 128 characters for the greek alphabet.  the [[petscii]] code [[commodore international]] used for their [[8-bit]] systems is probably unique among post-1970 codes in being based on ascii-1963, instead of the more common ascii-1967, such as found on the [[zx spectrum character set|zx spectrum]] computer. [[atascii|atari]] 8-bit computers and [[galaksija (computer)#character rom|galaksija]] computers also used ascii variants.  the ibm pc defined [[code page 437]], which replaced the control characters with graphic symbols such as [[emoticon|smiley faces]], and mapped additional graphic characters to the upper 128 positions. operating systems such as [[dos]] supported these code pages, and manufacturers of [[ibm pc]]s supported them in hardware. [[digital equipment corporation]] developed the [[multinational character set]] (dec-mcs) for use in the popular [[vt220]] [[computer terminal|terminal]] as one of the first extensions designed more for international languages than for block graphics. the macintosh defined [[mac os roman]] and postscript also defined a set, both of these contained both international letters and typographic punctuation marks instead of graphics, more like modern character sets.  the [[iso/iec 8859]] standard (derived from the dec-mcs) finally provided a standard that most systems copied (at least as accurately as they copied ascii, but with many substitutions). a popular further extension designed by microsoft, [[windows-1252]] (often mislabeled as [[iso-8859-1]]), added the typographic punctuation marks needed for traditional text printing.  iso-8859-1, windows-1252, and the original 7-bit ascii were the most common character encodings until 2008 when [[utf-8]] became more common.&lt;ref name="utf-8_2008"/&gt;  iso/iec 4873 introduced 32 additional control codes defined in the 80&#x2013;9f [[hexadecimal]] range, as part of extending the 7-bit ascii encoding to become an 8-bit system.&lt;ref name="unicode-5.0_2006"&gt;{{cite book |author=the unicode consortium |editor-first=julie d. |editor-last=allen |title=the unicode standard, version 5.0 |date=2006-10-27 |publisher=[[addison-wesley professional]] |location=upper saddle river, new jersey, us |isbn=0-321-48091-0 |chapter-url=http://unicode.org/book/ch13.pdf |access-date=2015-03-13 |chapter-format=pdf |chapter=chapter 13: special areas and format characters |page=314}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ===unicode=== {{main|unicode|iso/iec 10646}}{{see also|basic latin (unicode block)}} [[unicode]] and the iso/iec 10646 [[universal character set]] (ucs) have a much wider array of characters and their various encoding forms have begun to supplant iso/iec 8859 and ascii rapidly in many environments. while ascii is limited to 128 characters, unicode and the ucs support more characters by separating the concepts of unique identification (using [[natural number]]s called ''code points'') and encoding (to 8-, 16- or 32-bit binary formats, called [[utf-8]], [[utf-16]] and [[utf-32]]).  ascii was incorporated into the unicode (1991) character set as the first 128 symbols, so the 7-bit ascii characters have the same numeric codes in both sets. this allows [[utf-8]] to be [[backward compatibility|backward compatible]] with 7-bit ascii, as a utf-8 file containing only ascii characters is identical to an ascii file containing the same sequence of characters.  even more importantly, [[forward compatibility]] is ensured as software that recognizes only 7-bit ascii characters as special and does not alter bytes with the highest bit set (as is often done to support 8-bit ascii extensions such as iso-8859-1) will preserve utf-8 data unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=utf-8(7)&amp;nbsp;&#x2013;

'''traditional animation''' (also called cel animation or hand-drawn animation) was the process used for most animated films of the 20th century.{{sfn|white|2006|p=31}} the individual frames of a traditionally animated film are photographs of drawings, first drawn on paper.{{sfn|beckerman|2003|p=153}} to create the illusion of movement, each drawing differs slightly from the one before it. the animators' drawings are traced or photocopied onto transparent acetate sheets called [[cel]]s,{{sfn|thomas|johnston|1981|pp=277&#x2013;279}} which are filled in with paints in assigned colors or tones on the side opposite the line drawings.{{sfn|laybourne|1998|p=203}} the completed character cels are photographed one-by-one against a painted background by a [[rostrum camera]] onto motion picture

films are animated at 24 frames per second, with a combination of animation on ones and twos, meaning that drawings can be held for one frame out of 24 or two frames out of 24.{{sfn|laybourne|1998|pp=25&#x2013;26}}  ==== limited animation ====  {{main article|limited animation}}  '''[[limited animation]]''' involves the use of less detailed or more stylized drawings and methods of movement usually a choppy or "skippy" movement animation.{{sfn|beckerman|2003|p=142}} limited animation uses fewer drawings per second, thereby limiting the fluidity of the animation. this is a more economic technique. pioneered by the artists at the american studio [[united productions of america]],{{sfn|beckerman|2003|pp=54&#x2013;55}} limited animation can be used as a method of stylized artistic expression, as in ''[[gerald mcboing-boing]]'' (us, 1951), ''[[yellow submarine (1968 film)|yellow submarine]]'' (uk, 1968), and certain [[anime]] produced in

twain (1985 film)|the adventures of mark twain]]''.{{sfn|beck|2004|p=250}} ** '''[[strata-cut animation]]''', strata-cut animation is most commonly a form of clay animation in which a long bread-like "loaf" of clay, internally packed tight and loaded with varying imagery, is sliced into thin sheets, with the animation camera taking a frame of the end of the loaf for each cut, eventually revealing the movement of the internal images within.{{sfn|furniss|1998|pp=52&#x2013;54}} * '''[[cutout animation]]''' is a type of stop-motion animation produced by moving two-dimensional pieces of material paper or cloth.{{sfn|laybourne|1998|pp=59&#x2013;60}} examples include [[terry gilliam]]'s animated sequences from ''[[monty python's flying circus]]'' (uk, 1969&#x2013;1974); ''[[fantastic planet]]'' (france/czechoslovakia, 1973) ; ''[[tale of tales (1979 film)|tale of tales]]'' (russia, 1979), the pilot episode of the adult television sitcom series (and sometimes in episodes) of ''[[south

named "vermithrax" from ''[[dragonslayer]]'' (1981 film).{{sfn|smith|1986|pages=91&#x2013;95}} * '''[[object animation]]''' refers to the use of regular inanimate objects in stop-motion animation, as opposed to specially created items.{{sfn|laybourne|1998|pp=51&#x2013;57}} ** '''[[graphic animation]]''' uses non-drawn flat visual graphic material (photographs, newspaper clippings, magazines, etc.), which are sometimes manipulated frame-by-frame to create movement.{{sfn|laybourne|1998|p=128}} at other times, the graphics remain stationary, while the stop-motion camera is moved to create on-screen action. ** '''[[brickfilm]]''' are a subgenre of object animation involving using [[lego]] or other similar brick toys to make an animation.{{sfn|paul|2005|pages=357&#x2013;363}}{{sfn|herman|2014}} these have had a recent boost in popularity with the advent of video sharing sites, [[youtube]] and the availability of cheap

labor-intensive and have high production costs.{{sfn|solomon|1989|p=274}}  the most important difference is that once a film is in the production phase, the [[marginal cost]] of one more shot is higher for animated films than live-action films.{{sfn|white|2006|p=151}} it is relatively easy for a director to ask for one more [[take]] during [[principal photography]] of a live-action film, but every take on an animated film must be manually rendered by animators (although the task of rendering slightly different takes has been made less tedious by modern computer animation).{{sfn|laybourne|1998|p=339}} it is pointless for a studio to pay the salaries of dozens of animators to spend weeks creating a visually dazzling five-minute scene if that scene fails to effectively advance the plot of the film.{{sfn|culhane|1990|p=55}} thus, animation studios starting with disney began the practice in the 1930s of maintaining story departments where [[storyboard artist]]s develop every single scene through [[storyboard]]s, then handing the film over to the animators only after the production team is satisfied that all the scenes will make sense as a whole. {{sfn|solomon|1989|p=120}} while live-action films are now also storyboarded, they enjoy more latitude to depart from storyboards (i.e., real-time improvisation).{{sfn|laybourne|1998|pp=100&#x2013;101}}  another problem unique to animation is the necessity of ensuring that the style of an animated film is consistent from start to finish, even as films have grown longer and teams have grown larger.  animators, like all artists, necessarily have their own individual styles, but must subordinate their individuality in a consistent way to whatever style was selected for a particular film.{{sfn|masson|2007|p=94}} since the early 1980s, feature-length animated films have been created by teams of about 500 to 600 people, of whom 50 to 70 are animators.  it is relatively easy for two or three artists to match each other's styles; it is harder to keep dozens of artists synchronized with one another.{{sfn|beck|2004|p=37}}  this problem is usually solved by having a separate group of visual development artists develop an overall look and palette for each film before animation begins. character designers on the visual development team draw [[model sheet]]s to show how each character should look like with different facial expressions, posed in different positions, and viewed from different angles.{{sfn|williams|2001|p=34}}{{sfn|culhane|1990|p=146}} on traditionally animated projects, [[maquette]]s were often sculpted to further help the animators see how characters would look from different angles.{{sfn|williams|2001|pp=52&#x2013;57}}{{sfn|williams|2001|p=34}}  unlike live-action films, animated films were traditionally developed beyond the synopsis stage through the storyboard format; the storyboard artists would then receive credit for writing the film.{{sfn|laybourne|1998|pp=99&#x2013;100}} in the early 1960s, animation studios began hiring professional screenwriters to write screenplays (while also continuing to use story departments) and screenplays had become commonplace for animated films by the late 1980s.  ==criticism== criticism of animation has been common in media and cinema since its inception. with its popularity, a large amount of criticism has arisen, especially animated feature-length films.{{sfn|amidi|2011}} many concerns of cultural representation, psychological effects on children have been brought up around the animation industry, which has remained rather politically unchanged and stagnant since its inception into mainstream culture.{{sfn|nagel|2008}}  certain under-representation of women has also been criticized in animation films and the industry.{{sfn|nagel|2008}}{{sfn|zohn|2010}}  ==awards== as with any other form of media, animation too has instituted awards for excellence in the field. the original awards for animation were presented by the [[academy of motion picture arts and sciences]] for animated shorts from the year 1932, during the 5th [[academy awards]] function. the first winner of the [[5th academy awards|academy award]] was the short ''[[flowers and trees]]'',{{sfn|walt disney family museum|2013}} a production by [[walt disney productions]].{{sfn|beckerman|2003|p=37}}{{sfn|shaffer|2010|page=211}} the academy award for a feature-length animated motion picture was only instituted for the year 2001, and awarded during the 74th academy awards in 2002. it was won by the film ''[[shrek]]'', produced by [[dreamworks]] and [[pacific data images]].{{sfn|beckerman|2003|pp=84&#x2013;85}} [[disney]]/[[pixar]] have produced the most films either to win or be nominated for the award. the list of both awards can be obtained here: *[[academy award for best animated feature]] *[[academy award for best animated short film]]  several other countries have instituted an award for best animated feature film as part of their national film awards: [[africa movie academy award for best animation]] (since 2008), [[bafta award for best animated film]] (since 2006), [[c&#xe9;sar award for best animated film]] (since 2011), [[golden rooster award for best animation]] (since 1981), [[goya award for best animated film]] (since 1989), [[japan academy prize for animation of the year]] (since 2007), [[national film award for best animated film]] (since 2006). also since 2007, the [[asia pacific screen award for best animated feature film]] has been awarded at the [[asia pacific screen awards]]. since 2009, the [[european film awards]] have awarded the [[european film award for best animated film]].   the [[annie award]] is another award presented for excellence in the field of animation. unlike the academy awards, the annie awards are only received for achievements in the field of animation and not for any other field of technical and artistic endeavor. they were re-organized in 1992 to create a new field for best animated feature. the 1990s winners were dominated by walt disney, however, newer studios, led by pixar &amp; dreamworks, have now begun to consistently vie for this award. the list of awardees is as follows:  *[[annie award for best animated feature]]

 ===youth=== four days after his birth, apollo killed the [[chthonic]] dragon [[python (mythology)|python]], which lived in [[delphi]] beside the [[castalian spring]]. this was the spring which emitted vapors that caused the oracle at delphi to give her prophecies. hera sent the serpent to hunt leto to her death across the world. to protect his mother, apollo begged [[hephaestus]] for a bow and arrows. after receiving them, apollo cornered python in the sacred cave at delphi.&lt;ref&gt;''children of the gods'' by kenneth mcleish, page 32.&lt;/ref&gt; apollo killed python but had to be punished for it, since python was a child of [[gaia (mythology)|gaia]].  hera then sent the giant [[tityos]] to rape leto. this time apollo was aided by his sister artemis in protecting their mother. during the battle zeus finally relented his aid and hurled tityos down to [[tartarus]]. there, he was pegged to the rock floor, covering an area of {{convert|9|acre|m2}}, where a pair of [[vulture]]s feasted daily on his liver.  ===trojan war=== [[file:marble bust of apollo.jpg|thumb|marble bust of apollo after the [[apollo belvedere]]. circa 1675]] apollo shot arrows infected with the plague into the greek encampment during the [[trojan war]] in retribution for [[agamemnon]]'s insult to [[chryses]], a priest of apollo whose daughter [[chryseis]] had been captured. he demanded her return, and the achaeans complied, indirectly causing the ''[[achilles and patroclus#in the iliad|anger of achilles]]'', which is the theme of the ''[[iliad]]''.  in the iliad, when [[diomedes]] injured [[aeneas]], apollo rescued him. first, [[aphrodite]] tried to rescue aeneas but diomedes injured her as well. aeneas was then enveloped in a cloud by apollo, who took him to pergamos, a sacred spot in [[troy]].  apollo aided [[paris (mythology)|paris]] in the killing of achilles by guiding the arrow of his bow into [[achilles]]' heel. one interpretation of his motive is that it was in revenge for achilles' sacrilege in murdering [[troilus]], the god's own son by [[hecuba]], on the very [[ancient greek religion#practices|altar]] of the god's own temple.  ===admetus=== when zeus struck down apollo's son asclepius with a lightning bolt for resurrecting [[hippolytus (mythology)|hippolytus]] from the dead (transgressing [[themis]] by stealing [[hades]]'s subjects), apollo in revenge killed the [[cyclops|cyclopes]], who had fashioned the bolt for zeus.&lt;ref&gt;pseudo-apollodorus, ''[[bibliothke]]'' iii. 10.4.&lt;/ref&gt; apollo would have been banished to [[tartarus]] forever for this, but was instead sentenced to one year of [[penal labour|hard labor]], due to the intercession of his mother, [[leto]]. during this time he served as [[shepherd]] for [[admetus|king admetus]] of [[pherae]] in [[thessaly]]. admetus treated apollo well, and, in return, the god conferred great benefits on admetus.  apollo helped admetus win [[alcestis]], the daughter of [[pelias|king pelias]] and later convinced the [[moirai|fates]] to let admetus live past his time, if another took his place. but when it came time for admetus to die, his parents, whom he had assumed would gladly die for him, refused to cooperate. instead, alcestis took his place, but [[heracles]] managed to "''[[coercion|persuade]]''" [[thanatos]], the god of death, to return her to the world of the living.  [[file:niobe jacqueslouisdavid 1772 dallas museum of art.jpg|thumb|250px|''artemis and apollo piercing niobe's children with their arrows'' by [[jacques-louis david]], [[dallas museum of art]]]]  ===niobe=== [[niobe]], the queen of [[thebes (greece)|thebes]] and wife of [[amphion]], boasted of her superiority to leto because she had fourteen children ([[niobids]]), seven male and seven female, while leto had only two. apollo killed her sons, and artemis her daughters. apollo and artemis used poisoned arrows to kill them, though according to some versions of the myth, a number of the niobids were spared ([[chloris]], usually). amphion, at the sight of his dead sons, either killed himself or was killed by apollo after swearing revenge.  a devastated niobe fled to [[spil mount|mount sipylos]] in [[asia minor]] and turned into stone as she wept. her tears formed the river [[achelous]]. zeus had turned all the people of thebes to stone and so no one buried the niobids until the ninth day after their death, when the gods themselves entombed them.  ===consorts and children=== love affairs ascribed to apollo are a late development in greek mythology.&lt;ref&gt;"the love-stories themselves were not told until later."

[[marpessa]] was kidnapped by [[idas]] but was loved by apollo as well. [[zeus]] made her choose between them, and she chose idas on the grounds that apollo, being immortal, would tire of her when she grew old.  [[castalia]] was a [[nymph]] whom apollo loved. she fled from him and dove into the [[castalian spring|spring]] at delphi, at the base of [[mt. parnassos]], which was then named after her. water from this spring was sacred; it was used to clean the delphian temples and inspire the priestesses. in the last [[oracle]] is mentioned that the "water which could speak", has been lost for ever.  by [[cyrene (mythology)|cyrene]], apollo had a son named [[aristaeus]], who became the patron god of cattle, [[fruit trees]], hunting, husbandry and [[bee-keeping]]. he was also a [[culture-hero]] and taught humanity dairy skills, the use of nets and traps in hunting, and how to cultivate olives.  [[hecuba]] was the wife of king [[priam]] of [[troy]], and apollo had a son with her named [[troilus]]. an [[oracle]] prophesied that troy would not be defeated as long as troilus reached the age of twenty alive. he was ambushed and killed by [[achilleus]].  [[cassandra]], was daughter of hecuba and priam, and troilus' half-sister. apollo fell in love with cassandra and promised her the gift of prophecy to seduce her, but she rejected him afterwards. enraged, apollo indeed gave her the ability to know the future, with a curse that she could only see the future tragedies and that no one would ever believe her.  [[coronis (greek mythology)|coronis]], was daughter of [[phlegyas]], king of the [[lapiths]]. pregnant with [[asclepius]], coronis fell in love with [[ischys]], son of [[elatus]]. a crow informed apollo of the affair. when first informed he disbelieved the crow and turned all crows black (where they were previously white) as a punishment for spreading untruths. when he found out the truth he sent his sister, artemis, to kill coronis (in other stories, apollo himself had killed coronis). as a result, he also made the crow sacred and gave them the task of announcing important deaths. apollo rescued the baby and gave it to the [[centaur]] [[chiron]] to raise. phlegyas was irate after the death of his daughter and burned the temple of apollo at delphi. apollo then killed him for what he did.  in [[euripides]]' play ''[[ion (play)|ion]]'', apollo fathered [[ion (mythology)|ion]] by [[creusa (daughter of erechtheus)|creusa]], wife of [[xuthus]]. creusa left ion to die in the wild, but apollo asked [[hermes]] to save the child and bring him to the oracle at [[delphi]], where he was raised by a priestess.  [[acantha]], was the spirit of the [[acanthus (genus)|acanthus]] tree, and apollo had one of his other liaisons with her. upon her death, apollo transformed her into a sun-loving herb.  according to the ''[[bibliotheca (pseudo-apollodorus)|biblioteca]]'', the "library" of mythology mis-attributed to apollodorus, he fathered the [[corybantes]] on the muse [[thalia (muse)|thalia]].&lt;ref&gt;apollodorus, [http://www.theoi.com/text/apollodorus1.html ''bibliotheca'', 1.3.4]. other ancient sources, however, gave the corybantes different parents; see [[james george frazer|sir james frazer]]'s [http://www.theoi.com/text/ap1a.html#46 note] on the passage in the ''bibliotheca''.&lt;/ref&gt;  ====consorts and children: extended list==== {{colbegin|2}} # [[acacallis (mythology)|acacallis]] ## amphithemis (garamas)&lt;ref&gt;[[apollonius rhodius]], ''argonautica'', 1491 ff&lt;/ref&gt; ## naxos, [[eponym]] of the island [[naxos (island)|naxos]]&lt;ref&gt;[[scholia]] on [[apollonius rhodius]], ''argonautica'', 1491 ff&lt;/ref&gt; ## phylacides ## phylander&lt;ref&gt;[[pausanias (geographer)|pausanias]], ''description of greece'', 10. 16. 5&lt;/ref&gt; # [[acantha]] # [[aethusa]] ## [[eleuther]] # [[aganippe]] ## chios&lt;ref&gt;[[pseudo-plutarch]], ''on rivers'', 7. 1&lt;/ref&gt; # alciope&lt;ref&gt;[[photius]], ''lexicon'' s. v. linos&lt;/ref&gt; ## [[linus (mythology)|linus]] (possibly) # [[amphissa (mythology)|amphissa / isse]], daughter of macareus # anchiale / [[acacallis (mythology)|acacallis]] ## oaxes&lt;ref&gt;[[servius]] on [[virgil]]'s eclogue 1, 65&lt;/ref&gt; # areia, daughter of cleochus / [[acacallis (mythology)|acacallis]] / deione ## [[miletus (mythology)|miletus]] # astycome, nymph ## eumolpus (possibly)&lt;ref&gt;[[photius]], ''lexicon'', s. v.

his mother, [[maia (mythology)|maia]], had been secretly impregnated by [[zeus]]. maia wrapped the infant in blankets but hermes escaped while she was asleep.  hermes ran to [[thessaly]], where apollo was grazing his cattle. the infant hermes stole a number of his cows and took them to a cave in the woods near [[pylos]], covering their tracks. in the cave, he found a [[tortoise]] and killed it, then removed the insides. he used one of the cow's intestines and the tortoise shell and made the first [[lyre]].  apollo complained to maia that her son had stolen his cattle, but hermes had already replaced himself in the blankets she had wrapped him in, so maia refused to believe apollo's claim. zeus intervened and, claiming to have seen the events, sided with apollo. hermes then began to play music on the lyre he had invented. apollo, a god of music, fell in love with the instrument and offered to allow exchange of the cattle for the lyre. hence, apollo then became a master of the lyre.  ===apollo in the ''oresteia''=== in [[aeschylus]]' ''[[oresteia]]'' trilogy, [[clytemnestra]] kills her husband, king [[agamemnon]] because he had sacrificed their daughter [[iphigenia]] to proceed forward with the trojan war, and [[cassandra]], a prophetess of apollo. apollo gives an order through the oracle at delphi that agamemnon's son, [[orestes]], is to kill clytemnestra and [[aegisthus]], her lover. orestes and pylades carry out the revenge, and consequently orestes is pursued by the [[erinyes]] or furies (female personifications of [[revenge|vengeance]]).  apollo and the furies argue about whether the [[matricide]] was justified; apollo holds that the bond of marriage is sacred and orestes was avenging his father, whereas the erinyes say that the bond of blood between mother and son is more meaningful than the bond of marriage. they invade his temple, and he says that the matter should be brought before athena. apollo promises to protect orestes, as orestes has become apollo's supplicant. apollo advocates orestes at the trial, and ultimately athena rules in favor of apollo.  ===other stories=== apollo killed the [[aloadae]] when they attempted to storm [[mount olympus (mountain)|mt. olympus]].  [[callimachus]] sang&lt;ref&gt;callimachus, ''hymn to apollo''2.5&lt;/ref&gt; that apollo rode on the back of a swan to the land of the [[hyperborea]]ns during the winter months.  apollo turned [[cephissus (mythology)|cephissus]] into a [[sea monster]].  another contender for the birthplace of apollo is the cretan islands of [[paximadia (islands)|paximadia]].  ====musical contests====  =====pan===== once [[pan (mythology)|pan]] had the audacity to compare his music with that of apollo and to challenge apollo, the god of the [[kithara]], the mountain-god [[tmolus]] was chosen to umpire. pan blew on his pipes, and with his rustic melody gave great satisfaction to himself and his faithful follower, [[midas]], who happened to be present. then apollo struck the strings of his lyre. tmolus at once awarded the victory to apollo, and all but midas agreed with the judgment. he dissented and questioned the justice of the award. apollo would not suffer such a depraved pair of ears any longer, and caused them to become the ears of a [[donkey]].  =====marsyas===== [[file:marsyas_istanbul_archaeological_museum_-_inv._400_t_01.jpg|thumb|upright|[[marsyas]] under apollo's punishment, [[istanbul archaeology museums|&#x130;stanbul archaeology museum]]]]  apollo has ominous aspects aside from his plague-bringing, death-dealing arrows: [[marsyas]] was a [[satyr]] who challenged apollo to a contest of music. he had found an [[aulos]] on the ground, tossed away after being invented by [[athena]] because it made her cheeks puffy. the contest was judged by the [[muse]]s.  after they each performed, both were deemed equal until apollo decreed they play and sing at the same time. as apollo played the [[lyre]], this was easy to do. marsyas could not do this, as he only knew how to use the flute and could not sing at the same time. apollo was declared the winner because of this. apollo [[flaying|flayed]] marsyas alive in a cave near [[celaenae]] in [[phrygia]] for his [[hubris]] to challenge a god. he then nailed marsyas' shaggy skin to a nearby pine-tree. marsyas' blood turned into the river [[marsyas (river)|marsyas]].  another variation is that apollo played his instrument (the lyre) upside down. marsyas could not do this with his instrument (the [[flute]]), and so apollo hung him from a tree and flayed him alive.&lt;ref&gt;''man myth and magic'' by richard cavendish&lt;/ref&gt;

''the greek experience'', p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; a fine example is the statue of the ''sacred gate kouros'' which was found at the cemetery of [[dipylon]] in athens ([[dipylon]] [[kouros]]). the statue is the "thing in itself", and his slender face with the deep eyes express an intellectual eternity. according to the greek tradition the [[dipylon|dipylon master]] was named [[daedalus]], and in his statues the limbs were freed from the body, giving the impression that the statues could move. it is considered that he created also the ''new york kouros'', which is the oldest fully preserved statue of ''kouros'' type, and seems to be the incarnation of the god himself.&lt;ref name=homann63/&gt;  [[file:7262 - piraeus arch. museum, athens - the piraeus apollo - photo by giovanni dall'orto, nov 14 2009.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[piraeus apollo]], archaic-style bronze, [[archaeological museum of piraeus]]]] the animistic idea as the representation of the imaginative reality, is sanctified in the [[homeric]] poems and in greek myths, in stories of the god [[hephaestus]] ([[phaistos]]) and the mythic [[daedalus]] (the builder of the [[labyrinth]]) that made images which moved of their own accord. this kind of art goes back to the [[minoan civilization|minoan]] period, when its main theme was the representation of motion in a specific moment.&lt;ref name="schachermeyer242"&gt;f. schachermeyer (1964).

''les kouroi des ptoion''.&lt;/ref&gt; the last stage in the development of the ''kouros type'' is the late archaic period (520&#x2013;485 bc), in which the greek sculpture attained a full knowledge of human anatomy and used to create a relative harmonious whole. ranking from the very few bronzes survived to us is the masterpiece bronze [[piraeus apollo]]. it was found in [[piraeus]], the harbour of athens. the statue originally held the bow in its left hand, and a cup of pouring libation in its right hand. it probably comes from north-eastern [[peloponnesus]]. the emphasis is given in anatomy, and it is one of the first attempts to represent a kind of motion, and beauty relative to proportions, which appear mostly in post-archaic art. the statue throws some light on an artistic centre which, with an independently developed harder, simpler, and heavier style, restricts [[ionia]]n influence in athens. finally, this is the germ from which the art of [[polykleitos]] was to grow two or three generations later.&lt;ref name="homann144"&gt;homann-wedeking (1966).

[[polykleitos]] in his ''canon'' wrote that beauty consists in the proportion not of the elements (materials), but of the parts, that is the interrelation of parts with one another and with the whole. it seems that he was influenced by the theories of [[pythagoras]].&lt;ref&gt;"each part (finger, palm, arm, etc.) transmitted its individual existence to the next, and then to the whole" : ''canon of [[polykleitos]]'', also [[plotinus]], ''ennead'' i vi. i: nigel spivey (1997). ''greek art'', phaidon press ltd. london. pp. 290&#x2013;294.&lt;/ref&gt; the famous ''apollo of mantua'' and its variants are early forms of the [[apollo citharoedus]] statue type, in which the god holds the [[cithara]] in his left arm. the type is represented by [[neo-attic]] imperial roman copies of the late 1st or early 2nd century, modelled upon a supposed greek bronze original made in the second quarter of the 5th century bce, in a style similar to works of [[polykleitos]] but more archaic. the apollo held the ''cythara'' against his extended left arm, of which in the louvre example, a fragment of one twisting scrolling horn upright remains against his biceps.  though the proportions were always important in greek art, the appeal of the greek sculptures eludes any explanation by proportion alone. the statues of apollo were thought to incarnate his living presence, and these representations of illusive imaginative reality had deep roots in the [[minoan civilization|minoan]] period, and in the beliefs of the first [[greek language|greek]] speaking people who entered the region during the bronze-age. just as the greeks saw the mountains, forests, sea and rivers as inhabited by concrete beings, so nature in all of its manifestations possesses clear form, and the form of a work of art. spiritual life is incorporated in matter, when it is given artistic form. just as in the arts the greeks sought some reality behind appearances, so in mathematics they sought permanent principles which could be applied wherever the conditions were the same. artists and sculptors tried to find this ideal order in relation with mathematics, but they believed that this ideal order revealed itself not so much to the dispassionate intellect, as to the whole sentient self.&lt;ref name=homann63/&gt; things as we see them, and as they really are, are one, that each stresses the nature of the other in a single unity.  ===pediments and friezes=== [[file:apollo west pediment olympia copy mfa munich.jpg|thumb|upright|apollo, west pediment olympia. munich, copy from original, 460 bce at the [[temple of zeus, olympia|temple of zeus]], [[olympia, greece]].]] in the archaic pediments and friezes of the temples, the artists had a problem to fit a group of figures into an isosceles triangle with acute angles at the base.  the [[siphnian treasury]] in [[delphi]] was one of the first greek buildings utilizing the solution to put the dominating form in the middle, and to complete the descending scale of height with other figures sitting or kneeling. the pediment shows the story of [[heracles]] stealing apollo's tripod that was strongly associated with his oracular inspiration. their two figures hold the centre. in the pediment of the temple of [[zeus]] in [[olympia, greece|olympia]], the single figure of apollo is dominating the scene.&lt;ref name=bowra144/&gt;  [[file:part of the bassae frieze at the british museum.jpg|thumb|left|part of the [[bassae frieze]] at the [[british museum]]. apollo and artemis in the northeast corner.]] [[file:belvedere apollo pio-clementino inv1015 n3.jpg|thumb|head of the ''[[apollo belvedere]]'']]  these representations rely on presenting scenes directly to the eye for their own visible sake. they care for the schematic arrangements of bodies in space, but only as parts in a larger whole. while each scene has its own character and completeness it must fit into the general sequence to which it belongs. in these archaic pediments the sculptors use empty intervals, to suggest a passage to and fro a busy battlefield. the artists seem to have been dominated by geometrical pattern and order, and this was improved when classical art brought a greater freedom and economy.&lt;ref name=bowra144/&gt;  ===hellenistic greece-rome=== apollo as a handsome beardless young man, is often depicted with a [[kithara]] (as [[apollo citharoedus]]) or bow in his hand, or reclining on a tree (the [[apollo lykeios]] and [[apollo sauroctonos]] types). the [[apollo belvedere]] is a [[marble]] sculpture that was rediscovered in the late 15th century; for centuries it epitomized the ideals of [[classical antiquity]] for europeans, from the [[renaissance]] through the 19th century. the marble is a [[hellenistic greece|hellenistic]] or roman copy of a bronze original by the greek sculptor [[leochares]], made between 350 and 325 bce.  the life-size so-called "[[adonis]]" found in 1780 on the site of a ''[[roman villa|villa suburbana]]'' near the [[via labicana]] in the roman suburb of centocelle is identified as an apollo by modern scholars. in the late 2nd century ce floor mosaic from [[el djem]], roman ''thysdrus'', he is identifiable as [[helios|apollo helios]] by his effulgent [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]], though now even a god's divine [[nudity|nakedness]] is concealed by his cloak, a mark of increasing conventions of modesty in the later [[roman empire|empire]].

along the way, agassi overcame two former wimbledon champions: [[boris becker]] and [[john mcenroe]]. no other baseliner would triumph at wimbledon until [[lleyton hewitt]] ten years later. agassi was named the [[bbc sports personality of the year overseas personality|bbc overseas sports personality of the year]] in 1992. agassi once again played on the united states' [[davis cup]] winning team in 1992. it was their second davis cup title in three years.  in 1993, agassi won the only doubles title of his career, at the [[cincinnati masters]], partnered with [[petr korda]]. he missed much of the early part of that year due to injuries. although he made the quarterfinals in his wimbledon title defense, he lost to eventual champion and world no. 1 pete sampras in five sets. agassi lost in the first round at the us open to [[thomas enqvist]] and required wrist surgery late in the year.  ===1994&#x2013;1997: rise to the top, olympic gold and the fall=== with new coach [[brad gilbert]] on board, agassi began to employ more of a tactical, consistent approach, which fueled his resurgence. he started slowly in 1994, losing in the first week at the french open and wimbledon. nevertheless, he emerged during the hard-court season, winning the [[canada masters|canadian open]]. his comeback culminated at the [[1994 us open (tennis)|1994 us open]] with a five-set fourth-round victory against compatriot [[michael chang]]. he then became the first man to capture the us open as an [[seed (tennis)|unseeded]] player, beating [[michael stich]] in the final.&lt;ref name="greatath" /&gt; along the way, he beat 5 seeded players.  in 1995, agassi shaved his balding head, breaking with his old "image is everything" style. he competed in the [[1995 australian open]] (his first appearance at the event) and won, beating sampras in a four-set final.&lt;ref name="greatath" /&gt; agassi and sampras met in five tournament finals in 1995, all on [[hardcourt]], with agassi winning three. agassi won three masters series events in 1995 ([[cincinnati masters|cincinnati]], [[miami masters|key biscayne]], and the canadian open) and seven titles total.&lt;ref name="greatath" /&gt; he compiled a career-best 26-match winning streak during the summer hard-court circuit, with the last victory being in an intense late night four-set semifinal of the [[1995 us open (tennis)|us open]]  against [[boris becker]]. the streak ended the next day when agassi lost the final to sampras.  agassi reached the [[list of atp number 1 ranked players|world no. 1]] ranking for the first time in april 1995. he held that ranking until november, for a total of 30 weeks. agassi skipped most of the fall indoor season which allowed sampras to surpass him and finish ranked no. 1 at the year-ending ranking. in terms of win/loss record, 1995 was agassi's best year. he won 73 matches while losing 9 and was also once again a key player on the united states' [[davis cup]] winning team&#x2014;the third and final davis cup title of agassi's career.  1996 was a less successful year for agassi, as he failed to reach any grand slam final. he suffered two early-round losses at the hands of compatriots [[chris woodruff]] and [[doug flach]] at the french open and wimbledon, respectively, and lost to chang in straight sets in the australian and us open semifinals. at the time, agassi blamed the australian open loss on the windy conditions, but later said in his biography that he had lost the match on purpose, as he did not want to play boris becker, whom he would have faced in that final. the high point for agassi was winning the men's singles gold medal at the [[1996 summer olympics|olympic games]] in [[atlanta]], beating [[sergi bruguera]] of spain in the final.&lt;ref name="greatath" /&gt; agassi also successfully defended his singles titles in cincinnati and key biscayne.  1997 was the low point of agassi's career. his wrist injury resurfaced, and he played only 24 matches during the year. he later confessed that he started using [[methamphetamine|crystal methamphetamine]] at that time, allegedly on the urging of a friend.&lt;ref name="sports.espn.go.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/news/story?id=4600027 |title=andre agassi book says he used crystal meth |publisher=[[espn]] |accessdate=january 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 ==playing style== early in his career, agassi would look to end points quickly by playing first-strike tennis, typically by inducing a weak return with a deep, hard shot, and then playing a winner at an extreme angle. his groundstrokes, return of serve, baseline game, anticipation, and [[eye&#x2013;hand coordination]] were always among the best in the game. on the rare occasion that he charged the net, agassi liked to take the ball in the air and hit a swinging volley for the winner. his favored groundstroke was his flat, accurate two-handed backhand, hit well cross-court but in particular down the line. his forehand was nearly as strong, in particular his inside-out forehand to the ad court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author =nick bollettieri |url=http://www.tennisplayer.net/public/tour_strokes/nick_bollettieri/nick_bollet_agassi_backhand_images/nick_bollet_agassi_backhand.html?format=print |title=building the agassi backhand |website=tennisplayer.net |accessdate=june 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  agassi's strength was in dictating play from the back of the court. while he was growing up, his father and nick bollettieri trained him in this way.&lt;ref name="referencea"&gt;open: andre agassi harperscollins 2009&lt;/ref&gt; when in control of a point, agassi would often pass up an opportunity to attempt a winner and hit a conservative shot to minimize his errors, and to make his opponent run more. this change to more methodical, less aggressive baseline play was largely initiated by his longtime coach, brad gilbert, in their first year together in 1994. gilbert encouraged agassi to wear out opponents with his deep, flat groundstrokes and to use his fitness to win attrition wars, and noted agassi's two-handed backhand down the line as his very best shot.&lt;ref name="referencea" /&gt; a signature play later in his career was a change up drop shot to the deuce court after deep penetrating groundstrokes. this would often be followed by a passing shot or lob if the opponent was fast enough to retrieve it.  agassi was raised on hardcourts, but found much of his early major-tournament success on the red clay of roland garros, reaching two consecutive finals there early in his career. despite grass being his worst surface, his first major win was at the slick grass of wimbledon in 1992, a tournament that he professed to hating at the time.&lt;ref name="referencea" /&gt;
